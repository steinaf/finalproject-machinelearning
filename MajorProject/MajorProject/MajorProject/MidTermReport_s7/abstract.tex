Today, there is a massive amount of data available on the internet. While search engines have made searching for relevant pages trivial, extracting only the relevant sections of data from the huge set of search results has become very important. A machine learning approach to tackle this problem has the capability to keep adapting to the rapidly changing dynamics of the internet.

We plan to make an application which will take a topic as input and return a list of questions based on the topic from the internet and classify them based on difficulty.

The application will use popular web search engines to generate a list of pages which may contain questions pertaining to the supplied topic. Each page will be parsed into sections, each of which will then be analyzed using a machine learning approach to decide whether it is a relevant question or not and assign it a difficulty classification.
