                    <text>- Paging is solution to external fragmentation problem which is to permit the logical address space of a process to be noncontiguous, thus allowing a process to be allocating physical memory wherever the latter is available. * While running DOS on a PC, which command would be used to duplicate the entire diskette?
diskcopy * What resources are used when a thread created?
How do they differ from those when a process is created? - When a thread is created the threads does not require any new resources to execute the thread shares the resources like memory of the process to which they belong to.

                    <text>The benefit of code sharing is that it allows an application to have several different threads of activity all within the same address space.
Whereas if a new process creation is very heavyweight because it always requires new address space to be created and even if they share the memory then the inter process communication is expensive when compared to the communication between the threads. * What is virtual memory? - Virtual memory is hardware technique where the system appears to have more memory that it actually does.

                    <text>As in hard real time systems kernel delays need to be bounded * What is the cause of thrashing?
How does the system detect thrashing?
Once it detects thrashing, what can the system do to eliminate this problem? - Thrashing is caused by under allocation of the minimum number of pages required by a process, forcing it to continuously page fault.

                    <text>The system can detect thrashing by evaluating the level of CPU utilization as compared to the level of multiprogramming.
It can be eliminated by reducing the level of multiprogramming. * What is multi tasking, multi programming, multi threading? - Multi programming: Multiprogramming is the technique of running several programs at a time using timesharing.
It allows a computer to do several things at the same time.
Multiprogramming creates logical parallelism.

                <section>
                    <text>The concept of multiprogramming is that the operating system keeps several jobs in memory simultaneously.
The operating system selects a job from the job pool and starts executing a job, when that job needs to wait for any i/o operations the CPU is switched to another job.

                    <text>So the main idea here is that the CPU is never idle.
Multi tasking: Multitasking is the logical extension of multiprogramming .The concept of multitasking is quite similar to multiprogramming but difference is that the switching between jobs occurs so frequently that the users can interact with each program while it is running.
This concept is also known as time-sharing systems.

                    <text>This approach would multithread the web-server process, the server would create a separate thread that would listen for client requests when a request was made rather than creating another process it would create another thread to service the request.
To get the advantages like responsiveness, Resource sharing economy and utilization of multiprocessor architectures multithreading concept can be used. * What is hard disk and what is its purpose?
- Hard disk is the secondary storage device, which holds the data in bulk, and it holds the data on the magnetic medium of the disk.Hard disks have a hard platter that holds the magnetic medium, the magnetic medium can be easily erased and rewritten, and a typical desktop machine will have a hard disk with a capacity of between 10 and 40 gigabytes.

                    <text>DRAM data resides in a cell made of a capacitor and a transistor.
The capacitor tends to lose data unless it’s recharged every couple of milliseconds, and this recharging tends to slow down the performance of DRAM compared to speedier RAM types. * What is Dispatcher?
- Dispatcher module gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler; this involves: Switching context, Switching to user mode, Jumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that program, dispatch latency Ã¢â‚¬â€œ time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another running. * What is CPU Scheduler?

                    <text>- Selects from among the processes in memory that are ready to execute, and allocates the CPU to one of them.
CPU scheduling decisions may take place when a process: 1.Switches from running to waiting state.
2.Switches from running to ready state.
3.Switches from waiting to ready.

                    <text>4.Terminates.
Scheduling under 1 and 4 is non-preemptive.
All other scheduling is preemptive. * What is Context Switch? - Switching the CPU to another process requires saving the state of the old process and loading the saved state for the new process.
This task is known as a context switch.
Context-switch time is pure overhead, because the system does no useful work while switching.

                    <text>- When a process requests an available resource, system must decide if immediate allocation leaves the system in a safe state.
System is in safe state if there exists a safe sequence of all processes.
Deadlock Avoidance: ensure that a system will never enter an unsafe state. * What is a Real-Time System? - A real time process is a process that must respond to the events within a certain time period.

RAM is the most common type of memory found in computers and other devices, such as printers.

                    <text>The two types differ in the technology they use to hold data, dynamic RAM being the more common type.
Dynamic RAM needs to be refreshed thousands of times per second.
Static RAM does not need to be refreshed, which makes it faster; but it is also more expensive than dynamic RAM.
Both types of RAM are volatile, meaning that they lose their contents when the power is turned off.

                    <text>In common usage, the term RAM is synonymous with main memory, the memory available to programs.
For example, a computer with 8M RAM has approximately 8 million bytes of memory that programs can use.
In contrast, ROM (read-only memory) refers to special memory used to store programs that boot the computer and perform diagnostics.

                    <text>Most personal computers have a small amount of ROM (a few thousand bytes).
In fact, both types of memory (ROM and RAM) allow random access.
To be precise, therefore, RAM should be referred to as read/write RAM and ROM as read-only RAM.

                    <text>It is a useful, memory-saving technique for multiprogrammed timesharing systems.
A Reentrant Procedure is one in which multiple users can share a single copy of a program during the same period.
Reentrancy has 2 key aspects: The program code cannot modify itself, and the local data for each user process must be stored separately.
Thus, the permanent part is the code, and the temporary part is the pointer back to the calling program and local variables used by that program.

                    <text>Each execution instance is called activation.
It executes the code in the permanent part, but has its own copy of local variables/parameters.
The temporary part associated with each activation is the activation record.
Generally, the activation record is kept on the stack.
Note: A reentrant procedure can be interrupted and called by an interrupting program, and still execute correctly on returning to the procedure.

                    <text>Also called FIFO anomaly.
Usually, on increasing the number of frames allocated to a process virtual memory, the process execution is faster, because fewer page faults occur.
Sometimes, the reverse happens, i.e., the execution time increases even when more frames are allocated to the process.
This is Belady's Anomaly.
This is true for certain page reference patterns.

                    <text>Medium term scheduling is part of the swapping function.
This relates to processes that are in a blocked or suspended state.
They are swapped out of real-memory until they are ready to execute.
The swapping-in decision is based on memory-management criteria.

                    <text>The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor (also called aCPU), handles information.
The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system.

                    <text>To install a 64-bit version of Windows Vista, you need a processor that's capable of running a 64-bit version ofWindows.
The benefits of using a 64-bit operating system are most apparent when you have a large amount of random access memory (RAM) installed on your computer (typically 4 GB of RAM or more).
In such cases, because a 64-bit operating system can handle large amounts of memory more efficiently than a 32-bit operating system, a 64-bit operating system can be more responsive when running several programs at the same time and switching between them frequently.

I just purchased a MacBook Air and want to download it as part of my migration from the Windows environment to Mac.
Do I have to pay for a Mac download as well?

It sounds like you're really getting the full benefit of syncing 1Password between devices!

                    <text>However, since you're already getting a fresh start on the Mac, you may want to consider purchasing 1Password from the Mac App Store.

                <section>
                    <text>* Installation and updates are easily managed through the App Store interface. * You can install 1Password on multiple Macs using the same Apple ID. * App Store purchasers will automatically get a free upgrade to 1Password 4 when it is released in the future, bringing down your long-term cost.
Sorry to leave you with more questions than answers, but I want to be sure you're completely aware of your options, so you can make the best choice for your situation.

Although there are ways to prevent these pop-ups, they are, for the most part, not annoying or offensive.
There are other kinds of pop-ups that occur regardless of what site you are visiting, and can pop-up even when you are not even surfing the internet!

Spyware is a category of program that tracks your activities on your computer, and then responds to your activities by opening up internet browsers to pages that may sell products that your surfing activities indicate you may be interested in.
They call this a service.

Often you will not know what the program that is causing your problems is called, so only remove those programs that you know are unnecessary (anything with the words &quot;Buddy&quot;, or &quot;Ad&quot; are good bets).

                    <text>Other spyware programs cannot be removed by simply looking in the Add/Remove Control Panel.
Since we know that these programs must be run on startup, you can take care of this problem by looking through the startup tab of the msconfig utility.
Anything that is being run out of your profile directory, or temporary internet directory should be immediately unchecked.
Remember, very little actually needs to be run on startup -- look at the MS Config section of this site for more information on this.

                    <text>DLL Error In computers, a dynamic link library (DLL) is a collection of small programs, any of which can be called when needed by a larger program that is running in the computer.
The small program that lets the larger program communicate with a specific device such as a printer or scanner is often packaged as a DLL program (usually referred to as a DLL file).
DLL files that support specific device operation are known as device drivers.

                    <text>The advantage of DLL files is that, because they don't get loaded into random access memory (RAM) together with the main program, space is saved in RAM.
When and if a DLL file is needed, then it is loaded and run.
For example, as long as a user of Microsoft Word is editing a document, the printer DLL file does not need to be loaded into RAM.
If the user decides to print the document, then the Word application causes the printer DLL file to be loaded and run.

                    <text>Whenever you install a program it will, without doubt, install DLL files; programs will also update DLL files which are currently being used by other programs with their own custom version.
These custom versions may not be compatible with other programs that use this file; because of this it is incredible that Windows machines run nearly as well as they do.

Visit your software company's web site and browse until you reach the product update section.
Download and follow the page's installation instructions in order to correctly patch your software.
Even if the company does not have a fix for the problem, they may have a documented work-around in order to resolve the problem.

The next step would be to try and reinstall the software that is causing the problems.
For the best results, you will will want to uninstall the current version you are running, and then reinstall the software from scratch. make sure to back up any saved files/data that you use with the program before you uninstall the program.

                    <text>The form of the question is designed to mimic what the moderator of a technical interviewer would be asking and the answers are straightforward, giving enough detail to appear knowledgeable without reaching the point of overachieving.
The 200 questions in operating systems cover the full spectrum of an operating systems course; most of them could be the starting point for an excellent exam question.

                    <text>The second section of the book is a set of 51 questions that fit into the category of interview questions that an interviewee in any field could receive.
For example, question 26 is &quot;Tell me about a time when you successfully persuaded a group to accept your proposal.&quot;
Glancing through them would be an excellent way to start your preparatory process for the interview.
There is one flaw in the book and that is the many errors in Basic English.

                    <text>Reboot, and your PC should roll back to Windows Vista.
You can then open the setup log file \$WINDOWS.
BT\Sources\Panther\setupact.log to view what happened.
Microsoft say this is usually caused because the Iphlpsvc service has stopped responding, and just adding an environment variable to ignore it will fix the problem.
Point your browser at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/975253 for the fix.

                    <text>If this doesn't help (or your upgrade hangs at something other than 62%) then browse the setup log for other clues.
And you might also try to boot and install from the Windows 7 disc, if possible, as that reduces the chance of any conflict with your existing Vista (or XP) setup.

Resetting the drive letter has worked for some.
Click Start, type Disk Management and choose the &quot;Create and format hard disk partitions&quot; link.
If your optical drive is visible here then right-click it, select Change Drive Letter and Paths, click Change and choose a new letter.

                    <text>3. Aero isn't running If Windows 7 isn't looking its best - transparency has been turned off, say - then the Aero theme may not have been fully enabled on your system.
Click Start, type Aero, choose the &quot;Find and fix problems with transparency and other visual effects&quot; link, and click Next to launch the Aero troubleshooting wizard.
It'll try to identify and resolve and problems.
And if it doesn't, then install the latest driver for your graphics hardware.
That could be all your system needs.

                    <text>Some Aero features may be disabled in the Registry, though.
For example, if Aero Peek (the ability to make open windows transparent to display your desktop underneath) doesn't work for you, then launch REGEDIT, browse to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM and make sure EnableAeroPeek is set to 1, rather than 0.

                    <text>NO AERO: Windows 7's troubleshooting wizards will fix many display problems while you watch 4.
Aero Snap irritations Windows 7's new ability to move and resize windows, all in one movement, can be a genuine productivity boost.
But if you find windows moving around when you don't expect it then Aero Snap is more of an annoyance than anything else, though at least it's one you can disable in just a few seconds.

                    <text>5. iPhone won't sync in Windows 7 Irritated iPhone users are beginning to report major difficulties in getting their iPhone to sync with Windows 7 systems.
Particularly 64-bit Windows 7 systems, based around the P55 chipset.
The iPhone is usually (though not always) recognised, but iTunes then complains that it can't connect to the unit because of an &quot;unknown error&quot;, usually (though again, not always) 0xE8000065.

                    <text>SYNCING FEELING: iTunes on Windows 7 won't always see, or sync with, your iPod 6.
Windows 7 themes change your custom icons Windows 7 has some spectacular new themes - there's a great selection at the Microsoft site - but installing them can have one annoying side-effect.
If you've previously changed a system icon like Computer or the Recycle Bin then that could disappear, replaced by the equivalent icon from the theme pack.

Your icons will now be preserved, and the only way to change them will be manually, from the same Desktop Icons dialogue.

                    <text>* There are arguments both for and against running heterogeneous networks, but the deciding factor will mostly likely be your budget.
With unlimited resources, it would of course make sense to use the &quot;best of breed&quot; hardware and software for each service that you run on your network.

                    <text>For your Web site, for example, you might decide to use anApache Web server that runs on aLinux box, while your users authenticate and access the network via a Microsoft 2003 domain server.
Using the most suitable software for each service makes the overall system more robust and reliable.
Many application services are designed as multi-tier systems spanning database servers, application servers, Web servers and clients.

                    <text>It is common for different tiers of these services to execute on servers that use different operating systems.
If you use application-oriented clusters to host such applications, you can still achieve a unified view of the total application service, while making it more effective and less prone to error.
The main problem with this type of configuration, though, is that it introduces a serious amount of additional administrative overhead.

                    <text>Taking the example of a Linux Web server and a Windows domain, your IT department would need the skills to configure, maintain and support both Linux and Microsoft systems.
You would need an increased staff in order to achieve this, obviously adding to your overall IT costs.
Running a heterogeneous system will also increase the overall complexity of your network, which in turn increases the risk of errors or inadvertentdata security breaches caused by the diverse systems and components.

Not all software programs will be available in every OS version, so you may have to run completely different antispyware programs, for example, with each operating system.

                    <text>This further increases your administrative overhead.
You mention using a different platform for development than for other infrastructure operations.
Your development environment should certainly be kept separate from your day-to-day network operations, but by developing applications on a different platform altogether, you could end up with increased development costs and deployment issues.

Why have these predictions not panned out?
It seems to me, that from Tanenbaum's perspective, they're pretty reasonable predictions of the future.
What happened so that they didn't come to pass?

In fact, it's quite difficult to avoid that debate when discussing differences in kernel architectures.

                    <text>The sweetest irony is actually the signature,Linus &quot;my first, and hopefully last flamefest&quot; Torvalds which obviously failed to come true as well :) – Tim Post♦ Mar 22 '12 at 7:17 12   I'm leaving this as a comment instead of an answer (I don't think it's &quot;elaborate&quot; enough to be an answer): Tanenbaum wasnot wrong in believing Microkernels are better, that x86 should leave the arena and that the GNU OS (whatever kernel it runs on) was a better solution.
He was, maybe, naïve if he really stated a strong belief it would happen that fast (or happen at all), partly because of social inertia and monopolies, and partly because efficient microkernels aren't that easy to implement in general-purpose systems.
(so yeah, luck) – njsg Mar 22 '12 at 11:01 13   Tanenbaum is not totally wrong: in the new post PC era, iOS is based on Mach and ARM, Android is based on L4 and ARM.

                    <text>Certainly some lessons learned from microkernel research was applied to monolithic kernels.
Microsoft sometimes used to claim that theWin32 kernel was a microkernel architecture.
It's a bit of a stretch when you look at some textbook microkernels, but the claims had some technical justification.

                    <text>x86 will die out and RISC architectures will dominate the market If you back up from desktops and servers, RISC dominates the processor market by any measure.ARM (R stands for RISC) outsells x86 in number of processors, there are more ARM processors than x86 processors in use, and there is more total ARM computing capacity than x86 computing capacity.
This year, a single ARM vendor (yeah, Apple) may outsell all x86 vendors combined.

Intel engineers did some amazing work to squeeze life out of their instruction set, even to the point of making a RISC core with an opcode translator that sits on top.
Compare to one of the dominant RISC desktop chip makers, IBM, who could not get a power-efficient and high performanceG5 for Apple laptops in a reasonable timeframe.

                    <text>(5 years from then) everyone will be running a free GNU OS I think the various OS vendors still offer compelling value propositions on their OSes.
GNU isn't even necessarily the most important player in the Open Source community, so even a more widespread adoption of open source software didn't necessarily translate into GNU OSes.

If a google server farm runs linux (does it?) and each box counts toward the linux count, and my cable modem running a stripped down version of linux counts, and my android phone counts, then linux probably dominates.

RISC CPUs could get that too but at this point you're not comparing RISC vs.

                    <text>The biggest thing that was overlooked in this debate was the impact of CPU manufacturing technology and economics, driven by shrinking transistor sizes as expressed in Moore's Law (not surprising as though they knew a lot about CPU hardware, these guys studied and debated software, not CPU manufacturing or economics).
Fixed manufacturing costs which are amortized over CPU's (e.g.
ISA design, CPU design and CPU production facilities) have grown rapidly, thereby increasing the value of economies of scale; with per unit CPU costs (in terms of &quot;bang for the buck&quot; &amp; &quot;bang for the watt&quot;) plummeting, the cost of a CPU needn't be amortized over such a broad selection of functions to provide value, so computing in products with fixed function has exploded; CPU transistor budgets have grown exponentially, therefore wasting a fixed number of transistors due inefficiencies in ISA design is of no consequence.

                    <text>1. CPU Scale Wins Over CPU Diversity The importance of economies of scale has made the benefits of a ISA/CPU targeting a larger (therefore broader) market outweighs the potential benefits from design choices which narrow the market for an ISA/CPU.
OS's can address larger and larger portions of the market per supported ISA/CPU, so there is little need (or even no need) for porting exercises to allow an OS ecosystem to thrive.
The problem domains ISA's &amp; CPU's target tend to be so broad that they mostly overlap, so for any software beyond a compiler, the size of porting exercises has also diminished.

Rather than implementing interrupt handling/scheduling, memory management, communication &amp; I/O, these non-portable bits address only a tiny fraction of the implementation of those services, with the vast majority of the architecture of even these core OS functions being portable.

Now ironically, open source has flourished in these fixed function devices, but more often than not, the benefits of those freedoms being realized more by those making the products rather than end users (which actually was true of the software market even back then: Microsoft was a big consumer of open source software, but their customers were not).

                    <text>Similarly, one could argue that open source has struggled more in the general purpose desktop space than anywhere else, but as the web and cloud computing has grown, desktop computing has increasingly been used for a narrower purpose (primarily running a browser), with the remaining functions running in the cloud (ironically, primarily on open source platforms).
In short: open source does really own the general purpose computing space, but the market has become more sophisticated; computing product packaging less often stops at general purpose function, but continues along to product intended for fixed functions, where much of the advantage of open source computing is in conflict with the product goals.

                    <text>3. 2n Growth Means Fixed k Savings Are Not Important The exponential growth of transistor budgets has brought with it the realization that the transistor budget cost of a CISC architecture is almost completely fixed.
RISC's strategic advantage was that it moved complexity out of the CPU's instruction set and in to the compiler (no doubt partly motivated by the fact that compiler writers benefited far less from complex ISA's than human developers coding in assembly, but compilers could much more easily reason mathematically about, and therefore exploit, a simpler ISA); the resulting transistor savings could then be applied to improving CPU performance.
The caveat was that the transistor budget savings from a simpler ISA was mostly fixed (and overhead in compiler design was mostly fixed too).

                    <text>While this fixed impact was a huge chunk of the budget back in the day, as one can imagine it only takes a few rounds of exponential growth for the impact to become trivial.
This rapidly declining impact combined with the afore mentioned rapidly increasing importance of the CPU monoculture meant a very small window of opportunity for any new ISA to establish itself.
Even where new ISA's did succeed, modern &quot;RISC&quot; ISA's are are not the orthogonal ISA's described by the RISC strategy, as continued growth in transistor budgets and broader applicability of SIMD processing in particular has encouraged the adoption of new instructions tuned for specific functions.

                    <text>The modern Linux kernel (along with most other kernels) fits the rather loose definition of a macrokernel and not the rather than the narrow definition of a microkernel.
That said, with its driver architecture, dynamically loaded modules and multiprocessing optimizations which make kernel space communications increasingly resemble a microkernel's message passing, it's structure more closely resembles a microkernel design (as embodied by Minix) than the macrokernel design (as embodied by Linux's design at the time of the discussion).
Like a microkernel design, the Linux kernel does provide generalized communication, scheduling, interrupt handling, and memory management for all other OS components; its components do tend to have distinct code and data structures.

In the end, Moore's Law ensured that issues motivated by hardware concerns like portability (a concern of Tanenbaum's) &amp; performance (a concern of Torvalds') diminished, but software development issues became of paramount importance.
The remaining unrealized advantages that a separation of address spaces could provide are outweighed by the additional baggage imposed on the OS software due to design limitations and increased complexity of component interfaces.

Some claim that hypervisors are microkernels.
Hypervisor architecture is different though, as responsibilities meant to be owned by microkernels are handled by the &quot;guest&quot; kernels sitting atop, with hypervisors multiplex between them, and the hypervisor abstraction is not generic messaging and memory address space, but predominantly actual hardware emulation.

It's hard to make precise definitions about the future because there are so many factors outside of the argument that can come in to play; looser semantics means your predictions are a larger target on the dartboard than the other guy's, giving you way better odds.
If you ignore semantics, the arguments advanced by both Torvalds and Tanenbaum were right about a lot of things and wrong about very little.

If you want to claim your predictions proved right, leave yourself as much semantic maneuvering room as possible, just like Mr. Torvalds.

Today's &quot;x86&quot; chips are RISC under the hood, with basically a &quot;CISC interface&quot;. x86 didn't die out because Intel had enough market share and enough revenue to make that transition and get it right before other RISC solutions captured significant market share from them.

Are you seriously making the claim that a user today can pick up Linux and start doing the full repertoire of common end-user tasks without ever having to even know that a command-line even exists, the way they can on Windows or OSX? – Mason Wheeler Mar 22 '12 at 0:27 15   @Mason: when was the last time you've seen for example Ubuntu?
It's easier to do common end-user task on Ubuntu w/o knowing about console, than on OSX (hell, on OSX making hidden files visible requires Ph.D. in Nerdology).

People have argued for years about whether microkernels (nanokernels, picokernels, etc.) are technically superior, but for the moment, let's just assume they are.
We're still left with a question of whether that technical superiority is likely to translate to market dominance.

It's pretty easy to change things in a hurry when you have a new market.
To get essentially everybody changed over in five years, the migration would had to have been happening at full speed even as he predicted it.

People have already noted the ubiquity of RISC (e.g., in cell phones).
What they haven't mentioned is the ubiquity of what I'd call &quot;microkernel 2.0&quot;.
This is now more often known as a &quot;virtual machine&quot; or &quot;hypervisor&quot;.
They really are pretty much microkernels though.

                    <text>The big difference is that Tanenbaum thought in terms of a microkernel and a user-mode OS emulation both designed specifically for each other.
Instead, we've kept the OS essentially unchanged, and tailored the microkernel to run it as-is.
This isn't as nice technically, but from a market perspective, it's dramatically superior -- instead of a whole new system top to bottom, the user can continue to use most of his existing code as-is, and just add a cool new &quot;utility&quot; that happens to really be a microkernel OS.

Consumers particularly loved the GUI interfaces as opposed to the old text based systems of Unix and DOS.
This meant more average people would purchase computers for home use.
Also, the explosion of the Internet in the mid-90's increased sales.

This was due to the economies of scale presented by an increased consumer and business demand.
For example, all five of my current computers cost less combined than the one 486 desktop I purchased in 1992.

However, they go far beyond what was predicted in 1992.

So the existence of a stripped-down version of linux that is smaller in size than minix isn't really relevant. – Robz Mar 22 '12 at 0:31 @Robz Size is kind of relevant - the point of a microkernel is to give you portability, and enable certain edge cases (like running two OS environments on one machine at once without virtualisation).
If the microkernel is bigger than a hybrid/monolith that limits the platforms it can be deployed on, AND it tends to destroy the argument that it is easier to achieve portability by writing a small component if it is not in fact smaller than the alternative. – Marcin Mar 22 '12 at 11:11 up vote 5 down vote Ultimately it all comes down to the fact that things don't really like to change.

It's doing rather well in other non-desktop markets like embedded and mobile however.

Unfortunately, MIPS and SPARC never scaled up very well, and DEC ran out of money before the Alpha got enough market share to matter.
Intel was able to crank quite a bit of performance out of x86, so there really wasn't a compelling reason to change (for most people).

                <section>
                    <text>It is a useful, memory-saving technique for multiprogrammed timesharing systems.
A Reentrant Procedure is one in which multiple users can share a single copy of a program during the same period.
Reentrancy has 2 key aspects: The program code cannot modify itself, and the local data for each user process must be stored separately.
Thus, the permanent part is the code, and the temporary part is the pointer back to the calling program and local variables used by that program.

                    <text>Each execution instance is called activation.
It executes the code in the permanent part, but has its own copy of local variables/parameters.
The temporary part associated with each activation is the activation record.
Generally, the activation record is kept on the stack.
Note: A reentrant procedure can be interrupted and called by an interrupting program, and still execute correctly on returning to the procedure.

                    <text>Also called FIFO anomaly.
Usually, on increasing the number of frames allocated to a process virtual memory, the process execution is faster, because fewer page faults occur.
Sometimes, the reverse happens, i.e., the execution time increases even when more frames are allocated to the process.
This is Belady's Anomaly.
This is true for certain page reference patterns.

This relates to processes that are in a blocked or suspended state.
They are swapped out of real-memory until they are ready to execute.
The swapping-in decision is based on memory-management criteria.

                    <text>The form of the question is designed to mimic what the moderator of a technical interviewer would be asking and the answers are straightforward, giving enough detail to appear knowledgeable without reaching the point of overachieving.
The 200 questions in operating systems cover the full spectrum of an operating systems course; most of them could be the starting point for an excellent exam question.

                    <text>The second section of the book is a set of 51 questions that fit into the category of interview questions that an interviewee in any field could receive.
For example, question 26 is &quot;Tell me about a time when you successfully persuaded a group to accept your proposal.&quot;
Glancing through them would be an excellent way to start your preparatory process for the interview.
There is one flaw in the book and that is the many errors in Basic English.

                    <text>- Paging is solution to external fragmentation problem which is to permit the logical address space of a process to be noncontiguous, thus allowing a process to be allocating physical memory wherever the latter is available. * While running DOS on a PC, which command would be used to duplicate the entire diskette?
diskcopy * What resources are used when a thread created?
How do they differ from those when a process is created? - When a thread is created the threads does not require any new resources to execute the thread shares the resources like memory of the process to which they belong to.

                    <text>The benefit of code sharing is that it allows an application to have several different threads of activity all within the same address space.
Whereas if a new process creation is very heavyweight because it always requires new address space to be created and even if they share the memory then the inter process communication is expensive when compared to the communication between the threads. * What is virtual memory? - Virtual memory is hardware technique where the system appears to have more memory that it actually does.

                    <text>The system can detect thrashing by evaluating the level of CPU utilization as compared to the level of multiprogramming.
It can be eliminated by reducing the level of multiprogramming. * What is multi tasking, multi programming, multi threading? - Multi programming: Multiprogramming is the technique of running several programs at a time using timesharing.
It allows a computer to do several things at the same time.
Multiprogramming creates logical parallelism.

                    <text>The concept of multiprogramming is that the operating system keeps several jobs in memory simultaneously.
The operating system selects a job from the job pool and starts executing a job, when that job needs to wait for any i/o operations the CPU is switched to another job.

                    <text>So the main idea here is that the CPU is never idle.
Multi tasking: Multitasking is the logical extension of multiprogramming .The concept of multitasking is quite similar to multiprogramming but difference is that the switching between jobs occurs so frequently that the users can interact with each program while it is running.
This concept is also known as time-sharing systems.

                    <text>This approach would multithread the web-server process, the server would create a separate thread that would listen for client requests when a request was made rather than creating another process it would create another thread to service the request.
To get the advantages like responsiveness, Resource sharing economy and utilization of multiprocessor architectures multithreading concept can be used. * What is hard disk and what is its purpose?
- Hard disk is the secondary storage device, which holds the data in bulk, and it holds the data on the magnetic medium of the disk.Hard disks have a hard platter that holds the magnetic medium, the magnetic medium can be easily erased and rewritten, and a typical desktop machine will have a hard disk with a capacity of between 10 and 40 gigabytes.

                    <text>Data is stored onto the disk in the form of files. * What is fragmentation?
Different types of fragmentation? - Fragmentation occurs in a dynamic memory allocation system when many of the free blocks are too small to satisfy any request.External Fragmentation: External Fragmentation happens when a dynamic memory allocation algorithm allocates some memory and a small piece is left over that cannot be effectively used.

                    <text>If too much external fragmentation occurs, the amount of usable memory is drastically reduced.
Total memory space exists to satisfy a request, but it is not contiguous.Internal Fragmentation: Internal fragmentation is the space wasted inside of allocated memory blocks because of restriction on the allowed sizes of allocated blocks.

                    <text>DRAM data resides in a cell made of a capacitor and a transistor.
The capacitor tends to lose data unless it’s recharged every couple of milliseconds, and this recharging tends to slow down the performance of DRAM compared to speedier RAM types. * What is Dispatcher?
- Dispatcher module gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler; this involves: Switching context, Switching to user mode, Jumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that program, dispatch latency Ã¢â‚¬â€œ time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another running. * What is CPU Scheduler?

CPU scheduling decisions may take place when a process: 1.Switches from running to waiting state.
2.Switches from running to ready state.
3.Switches from waiting to ready.

Scheduling under 1 and 4 is non-preemptive.
All other scheduling is preemptive. * What is Context Switch? - Switching the CPU to another process requires saving the state of the old process and loading the saved state for the new process.
This task is known as a context switch.
Context-switch time is pure overhead, because the system does no useful work while switching.

                    <text>Its speed varies from machine to machine, depending on the memory speed, the number of registers which must be copied, the existed of special instructions(such as a single instruction to load or store all registers). * What is cache memory? - Cache memory is random access memory (RAM) that a computer microprocessor can access more quickly than it can access regular RAM.
As the microprocessor processes data, it looks first in the cache memory and if it finds the data there (from a previous reading of data), it does not have to do the more time-consuming reading of data from larger memory. * What is a Safe State and what is its use in deadlock avoidance?

System is in safe state if there exists a safe sequence of all processes.
Deadlock Avoidance: ensure that a system will never enter an unsafe state. * What is a Real-Time System? - A real time process is a process that must respond to the events within a certain time period.

RAM is the most common type of memory found in computers and other devices, such as printers.

                    <text>The two types differ in the technology they use to hold data, dynamic RAM being the more common type.
Dynamic RAM needs to be refreshed thousands of times per second.
Static RAM does not need to be refreshed, which makes it faster; but it is also more expensive than dynamic RAM.
Both types of RAM are volatile, meaning that they lose their contents when the power is turned off.

                    <text>In common usage, the term RAM is synonymous with main memory, the memory available to programs.
For example, a computer with 8M RAM has approximately 8 million bytes of memory that programs can use.
In contrast, ROM (read-only memory) refers to special memory used to store programs that boot the computer and perform diagnostics.

                    <text>Most personal computers have a small amount of ROM (a few thousand bytes).
In fact, both types of memory (ROM and RAM) allow random access.
To be precise, therefore, RAM should be referred to as read/write RAM and ROM as read-only RAM.

                    <text>When a thread is created the threads does not require any new resources to execute the thread shares the resources like memory of the process to which they belong to.
The benefit of code sharing is that it allows an application to have several different threads of activity all within the same address space.
Whereas if a new process creation is very heavyweight because it always requires new address space to be created and even if they share the memory then the inter process communication is expensive when compared to the communication between the threads.

Throughput – number of processes that complete their execution per time unit.
Turnaround time – amount of time to execute a particular process.
Waiting time – amount of time a process has been waiting in the ready queue.
Response time – amount of time it takes from when a request was submitted until the first response is produced, not output (for time-sharing environment).

                    <text>Real-Time systems may be either hard or soft real-time.
Hard real-time: Secondary storage limited or absent, data stored in short term memory, or read-only memory (ROM), Conflicts with time-sharing systems, not supported by general-purpose operating systems.
Soft real-time: Limited utility in industrial control of robotics, Useful in applications (multimedia, virtual reality) requiring advanced operating-system features.

                    <text>Ans: - Mutex is a program object that allows multiple program threads to share the same resource, such as file access, but not simultaneously.
When a program is started a mutex is created woth a unique name.
After this stage, any thread that needs the resource must lock the mutex from other threads while it is using the resource. the mutex is set to unlock when the data is no longer needed or the routine is finished.

                    <text>A processor executes threads, not processes, so each application has at least one process, and a process always has at least one thread of execution, known as the primary thread.
A process can have multiple threads in addition to the primary thread.
Prior to the introduction of multiple threads of execution, applications were all designed to run on a single thread of execution.

                    <text>When a thread begins to execute, it continues until it is killed or until it is interrupted by a thread with higher priority (by a user action or the kernel’s thread scheduler).
Each thread can run separate sections of code, or multiple threads can execute the same section of code.
Threads executing the same block of code maintain separate stacks.
Each thread in a process shares that process’s global variables and resources.

If change the sceduling of one process from A to B then the others task have no effect in linux but in VxWorks all task’s scheduling change to B, i.e. in VxWorks all the task have same scheduling but in linux it can different.
In Vxworks you can access any memory location(should be exist), but in linux you can access only the segment which have allocated for that process.

The process of gathering data and transforming it into a standard format before it is transmitted over a network so that the data can transcend network boundaries.
In order for an object to be moved around a network, it must be converted into a data stream that corresponds with the packet structure of the network transfer protocol.

So once a thread locks it, then other threads/processes will either spin or block on the mutex.
Whereas, semaphore allows one or more threads/processes to share the resource.

Ans:- A mutex object is a synchronization object whose state is set to signaled when it is not owned by any thread, and non-signaled when it is owned.
For example, to prevent two threads from writing to shared memory at the same time, each thread waits for ownership of a mutex object before executing the code that accesses the memory.
After writing to the shared memory, the thread releases the mutex object.

                    <text>Ans:- A semaphore object is a synchronization object that maintains a count between zero and a specified maximum value.
The count is decremented each time a thread completes a wait for the semaphore object and incremented each time a thread releases the semaphore.
When the count reaches zero, no more threads can successfully wait for the semaphore object state to become signaled.

                    <text>The state of a semaphore is set to signaled when its count is greater than zero, and non-signaled when its count is zero.
The semaphore object is useful in controlling a shared resource that can support a limited number of users.
It acts as a gate that limits the number of threads sharing the resource to a specified maximum number.

Serial access one toilet is available with a Key for it.one guy will have the key and will use the toilet, so making others to wait for access.once done, he gives the key to the other 2.

N resources access say for example 4 toilets are there; each has a common key for the toliets available.at the start semaphore value set to 4(4 toilets are free), once any user gets in ; semaphore decrements the value; once done he will increment saying it ; it’s FREE… * What is Mutex and Semaphore...???

Ans: A binary Semaphore and mutex are one and the same.A binary semaphore has different types like counting semaphore,binary semaphore.Let me put in this way a mutex is a semaphore with count as 1 that means synchronization is achived to process/thread for the resource in one by one manner * Krishna Pradeep Posted 6/26/2007 at 12:37 pm | Permalink The difference between an ordinary binary semaphore and a mutex semaphore is in the way the semaphore is initialized.

When it reaches the point to be synchronized, it attempts to take a semaphore.
If unavailable, it waits at this point.

When a mutex is locked by a thread, the same thread has to release it; it cannot be released by other thread.
When a binary semaphore is locked, the other thread can release it and then lock it again.

This means that the semaphore can be taken more than once by the task that holds it before finally being released.

                    <text>Semaphores exist in many variants, though usually the term refers to a counting semaphore, since a binary semaphore is better known as a mutex.
A counting semaphore is a counter for a set of available resources, rather than a locked/unlocked flag of a single resource.
It was invented by Edsger Dijkstra.
Semaphores are the classic solution to preventing race conditions in the dining philosophers problem, although they do not prevent resource deadlocks.

It is especially concerned with the operation and control of I/O devices.

                    <text>The benefit of code sharing is that it allows an application to have several different threads of activity all within the same address space.
Whereas if a new process creation is very heavyweight because it always requires new address space to be created and even if they share the memory then the inter process communication is expensive when compared to the communication between the threads.

As the microprocessor processes data, it looks first in the cache memory and if it finds the data there (from a previous reading of data), it does not have to do the more time-consuming reading of data from larger memory.

                    <text>Context-switch time is pure overhead, because the system does no useful work while switching.
Its speed varies from machine to machine, depending on the memory speed, the number of registers which must be copied, the existed of special instructions(such as a single instruction to load or store all registers).

DRAM data resides in a cell made of a capacitor and a transistor.
The capacitor tends to lose data unless it’s recharged every couple of milliseconds, and this recharging tends to slow down the performance of DRAM compared to speedier RAM types.

External Fragmentation: External Fragmentation happens when a dynamic memory allocation algorithm allocates some memory and a small piece is left over that cannot be effectively used.
If too much external fragmentation occurs, the amount of usable memory is drastically reduced.

Internal Fragmentation: Internal fragmentation is the space wasted inside of allocated memory blocks because of restriction on the allowed sizes of allocated blocks.
Allocated memory may be slightly larger than requested memory; this size difference is memory internal to a partition, but not being used → Leave a comment Posted in Operating System Interview Questions What is hard disk and what is its purpose?

It allows a computer to do several things at the same time.
Multiprogramming creates logical parallelism.
The concept of multiprogramming is that the operating system keeps several jobs in memory simultaneously.

                    <text>Multi tasking: Multitasking is the logical extension of multiprogramming .The concept of multitasking is quite similar to multiprogramming but difference is that the switching between jobs occurs so frequently that the users can interact with each program while it is running.
This concept is also known as time-sharing systems.

                    <text>A time-shared operating system uses CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide each user with a small portion of time-shared system.
Multi threading: An application typically is implemented as a separate process with several threads of control.
In some situations a single application may be required to perform several similar tasks for example a web server accepts client requests for web pages, images, sound, and so forth.
A busy web server may have several of clients concurrently accessing it.

                    <text>If the web server ran as a traditional single-threaded process, it would be able to service only one client at a time.
The amount of time that a client might have to wait for its request to be serviced could be enormous.

                    <text>So it is efficient to have one process that contains multiple threads to serve the same purpose.
This approach would multithread the web-server process, the server would create a separate thread that would listen for client requests when a request was made rather than creating another process it would create another thread to service the request.
To get the advantages like responsiveness, Resource sharing economy and utilization of multiprocessor architectures multithreading concept can be used.

                    <text>Posted on January 14, 2009 by vivek | Leave a comment Thrashing is caused by under allocation of the minimum number of pages required by a process, forcing it to continuously page fault.
The system can detect thrashing by evaluating the level of CPU utilization as compared to the level of multiprogramming.
It can be eliminated by reducing the level of multiprogramming.

This goal requires that all delays in the system be bounded from the retrieval of the stored data to the time that it takes the operating system to finish any request made of it.

                    <text>ANS: Mutex is a program object that allows multiple program threads to share the same resource, such as file access, but not simultaneously.
When a program is started a mutex is created with a unique name.
After this stage, any thread that needs the resource must lock the mutex from other threads while it is using the resource. the mutex is set to unlock when the data is no longer needed or the routine is finished.

ANS: A single process can have multiple threads that share global data and address space with other threads running in the same process, and therefore can operate on the same data set easily.
Processes do not share address space and a different mechanism must be used if they are to share data.

                    <text>Ans: Concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other.
The computations may be executing on multiple cores in the same chip, preemptively time-shared threads on the same processor, or executed on physically separated processors.
A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including Petri nets, process calculi, the Parallel Random Access Machine model and the Actor model.

In terms of graph theory, there is a directed circuit, in which processes and resources alternate exactly one by one, Starvation: This is mostly happens in time sharing systems in which the process which requires less time slot is waiting for the large process to finish and to release the resources but the large process holding the resources for long time (almost for forever) and the process that requires small time slot goes on waiting.
Such situation is starvation for small process.

                    <text>Because the waiter is aware of which forks are in use, he is able to arbitrate and prevent deadlock.
When four of the forks are in use, the next philosopher to request one has to wait for the waiter’s permission, which is not given until a fork has been released.
The logic is kept simple by specifying that philosophers always seek to pick up their left hand fork before their right hand fork (or vice versa).

Were he to take up the fifth fork, deadlock becomes likely.
If instead he asks the waiter and is told to wait, we can be sure that next time two forks are released there will certainly be at least one philosopher who could successfully request a pair of forks.
Therefore deadlock cannot happen.

                    <text>Resource hierarchy solution: Another simple solution is achieved by assigning a partial order to the resources (the forks, in this case), and establishing the convention that all resources will be requested in order, and released in reverse order, and that no two resources unrelated by order will ever be used by a single unit of work at the same time.
Here, the resources (forks) will be numbered 1 through 5, in some order, and each unit of work (philosopher) will always pick up the lower-numbered fork first, and then the higher-numbered fork, from among the two forks he plans to use.
Then, he will always put down the higher numbered fork first, followed by the lower numbered fork.

Moreover, only one philosopher will have access to that highest-numbered fork, so he will be able to eat using two forks.
When he finishes using the forks, he will put down the highest-numbered fork first, followed by the lower-numbered fork, freeing another philosopher to grab the latter and begin eating.

                    <text>While the resource hierarchy solution avoids deadlocks, it is not always practical, especially when the list of required resources is not completely known in advance.
For example, if a unit of work holds resources 3 and 5 and then determines it needs resource 2, it must release 5, then 3 before acquiring 2, and then it must re-acquire 3 and 5 in that order.
Computer programs that access large numbers ofdatabase records would not run efficiently if they were required to release all higher-numbered records before accessing a new record, making the method impractical for that purpose.

                    <text>In the absence of locks associated with the forks, philosophers must ensure that the decision to begin eating is not based on stale information about the state of the neighbors.
E.g. if philosopher B sees that A is not eating, then turns and looks at C, A could begin eating while B looks at C.
This solution avoids this problem by using a single mutual exclusion lock.
This lock is not associated with the forks but with the decision procedures that can change the states of the philosophers.

The procedures test, pickup and putdown are local to the monitor and share a mutual exclusion lock.
Notice that philosophers wanting to eat do not hold a fork.
When the monitor allows a philosopher who wants to eat to continue, the philosopher will reacquire the first fork before picking up the now available second fork.
When done eating, the philosopher will signal to the monitor that both forks are now available.

ANS: Virtual memory is a computer system technique which gives an application program the impression that it has contiguous working memory, while in fact it is physically fragmented and may even overflow on to disk storage.
Systems which use this technique make programming of large applications easier and use real physical memory (e.g. RAM) more efficiently than those without virtual memory.

                <section>
                    <text>A useful way to think of a semaphore is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are available, coupled with operations to safely (i.e. without race conditions) adjust that record as units are required or become free, and if necessary wait until a unit of the resource becomes available.
Semaphores are a useful tool in the prevention of race conditions and deadlocks; however, their use is by no means a guarantee that a program is free from these problems.
Semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count are called counting semaphores, whilst semaphores which are restricted to the values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are called binary semaphores.

This admission will be approved or delayed by a long-term, or admission, scheduler Ready or Waiting: A “ready&quot; or “waiting&quot; process has been loaded into main memory and is awaiting execution on a CPU (to be context switched onto the CPU by the dispatcher, or short-term scheduler).
There may be many “ready&quot; processes at any one point of the systems execution – for example, in a one processor system, only one process can be executing at any one time, and all other “concurrently executing&quot; processes will be waiting for execution.

Terminated: A process may be terminated, either from the “running&quot; state by completing its execution or by explicitly being killed.
In either of these cases, the process moves to the “terminated&quot; state.
If a process is not removed from memory after entering this state, this state may also be called zombie.

                <section>
                    <text>It is a useful, memory-saving technique for multiprogrammed timesharing systems.
A Reentrant Procedure is one in which multiple users can share a single copy of a program during the same period.
Reentrancy has 2 key aspects: The program code cannot modify itself, and the local data for each user process must be stored separately.
Thus, the permanent part is the code, and the temporary part is the pointer back to the calling program and local variables used by that program.

                    <text>Each execution instance is called activation.
It executes the code in the permanent part, but has its own copy of local variables/parameters.
The temporary part associated with each activation is the activation record.
Generally, the activation record is kept on the stack.
Note: A reentrant procedure can be interrupted and called by an interrupting program, and still execute correctly on returning to the procedure.

                    <text>Also called FIFO anomaly.
Usually, on increasing the number of frames allocated to a process virtual memory, the process execution is faster, because fewer page faults occur.
Sometimes, the reverse happens, i.e., the execution time increases even when more frames are allocated to the process.
This is Belady's Anomaly.
This is true for certain page reference patterns.

                    <text>Medium term scheduling is part of the swapping function.
This relates to processes that are in a blocked or suspended state.
They are swapped out of real-memory until they are ready to execute.
The swapping-in decision is based on memory-management criteria.

This scheduler is invoked whenever an event occurs.
It may lead to interruption of one process by preemption.

                    <text>Priority Scheduling: This method is quite same as the SJF but the difference is that instead of choosing the next process to work on by the shortest burst time, CPU chooses the next process by the shortest priority value.
Here, all the processes are given a priority value.
The process with the shortest (The most shortest is 1) priority will be worked on first and so on.

Well, as the unit of time you can take anything like nano-second, second, minute etc whatever.
We consider it as second.

                    <text>Now for an instance, consider the above list as the ready queue for the CPU, that is the CPU will take processes from this list and will process it.
Here in Priority Scheduling, what will happen is as follows, AT 0s:            There is only 1 job, that is Process-1 with Burst Time 3 and Priority 2.
So CPU will do 1 second job of Process-1.

Thus process-2 has more 1s job.
AT 2s:            Now there are 3 jobs,                        Process-1 that arrived at 0s and has 2s job to be done with Priority 2.

Ok, Look carefully, See the following time-line for Process-1.
Here, RED marked seconds symbolizes the seconds while Process-1 was waiting and GREEN marked second symbolizes the seconds while Process-1 was working.

Process-2 did not wait, it came at 1s and worked at 1s and 2s.
But Process-3 Arrived at the List of Process at 2s with a Burst Time of 1s.

                    <text>But CPU started processing Process-3 at 5s.
So process-3 waited for 3s.
Process-1 Process-2 Process-2 Process-1 Process-1 Process-3 0s 1s 2s 3s 4s 5s So total waiting time = (Waiting Time of Process-1)+ (Waiting Time of Process-2)                                      + (Waiting Time of Process-3)                                    = (2+0+3)s                                   = 5s So the average waiting time is = (Total waiting time / Number of Processes)s                                                  = (5/3)s                                                  = 1.66s Ok...I think you have understood the thing.

                    <text>Now lets talk about the program.
Input: You will ask the user for the number of processes.
Then for each process you will take its Process Number, Arrival Time, Burst time and Priority.

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>You don’t have to worry, the number of processes wont be more than 5 or 6, Arrival time of a process can only be equal or greater than the arrival time of its previous process and Process will be entered as a serial number, so no problem.
Priority values of 2 processes wont be same.
Output: In the output you will have to print out the shortened time-line we showed you above.

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>For example, if the input is as follows, Arrival Process Burst Time Priority 0 1 3 2 1 2 2 1 2 3 1 3 Then the shortened time-line will be, | Process-1 | Process-2 | Process-1 | Process-3 | 0                 1 3 5 6 You can also print out the time-line vertically if you want (thats what I have done, see the output of my program) Ok beneath this shortened time-line you will have to print a table as follows, Process Arrival Finish Total Wait 2 1 2 2 0 1 0 4 3 2 3 2 5 1 3                                              Beneath this, you will have to show the Average Waiting Time.
I know you have understood, now see a screen-shot of exactly what I was talking about, Exception: One exception is that, I said “Arrival time of a process can only be equal or greater than the arrival time of its previous process&quot;.
So take a look at the following list of process, Arrival Process Burst Time Priority 0 1 3 2 55 2 2 1 60 3 1 3 You see, the Job of Process-1 will complete at 2s, thus from 3s to 54s the CPU will remain idle.

                <section>
                    <text>Again the job of Process-2 will complete at 56s and thus from 57s to 59s the CPU will again remain as idle.
You have to show this in the output and also notice that none of the processes has waited.

                    <text>But that doesn't mean it's perfect, of course.
If you've moved to Windows 7 recently then you might have noticed various upgrade problems, interface issues and features that seem to have disappeared entirely, among many other complications with the new system.

Vista upgrade hangs at 62% Windows 7 can start causing problems before it's even installed, as many people report their upgrade hangs forever at 62%.
Which is annoying.

                    <text>Reboot, and your PC should roll back to Windows Vista.
You can then open the setup log file \$WINDOWS.
BT\Sources\Panther\setupact.log to view what happened.
Microsoft say this is usually caused because the Iphlpsvc service has stopped responding, and just adding an environment variable to ignore it will fix the problem.
Point your browser at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/975253 for the fix.

                    <text>If this doesn't help (or your upgrade hangs at something other than 62%) then browse the setup log for other clues.
And you might also try to boot and install from the Windows 7 disc, if possible, as that reduces the chance of any conflict with your existing Vista (or XP) setup.

Resetting the drive letter has worked for some.
Click Start, type Disk Management and choose the &quot;Create and format hard disk partitions&quot; link.
If your optical drive is visible here then right-click it, select Change Drive Letter and Paths, click Change and choose a new letter.
If the drive is now visible in Explorer, then repeat the process to change the drive letter back; if it's still not visible, reboot and it should appear.

                    <text>3. Aero isn't running If Windows 7 isn't looking its best - transparency has been turned off, say - then the Aero theme may not have been fully enabled on your system.
Click Start, type Aero, choose the &quot;Find and fix problems with transparency and other visual effects&quot; link, and click Next to launch the Aero troubleshooting wizard.
It'll try to identify and resolve and problems.
And if it doesn't, then install the latest driver for your graphics hardware.
That could be all your system needs.

                    <text>Some Aero features may be disabled in the Registry, though.
For example, if Aero Peek (the ability to make open windows transparent to display your desktop underneath) doesn't work for you, then launch REGEDIT, browse to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM and make sure EnableAeroPeek is set to 1, rather than 0.

Aero Snap irritations Windows 7's new ability to move and resize windows, all in one movement, can be a genuine productivity boost.
But if you find windows moving around when you don't expect it then Aero Snap is more of an annoyance than anything else, though at least it's one you can disable in just a few seconds.

                    <text>5. iPhone won't sync in Windows 7 Irritated iPhone users are beginning to report major difficulties in getting their iPhone to sync with Windows 7 systems.
Particularly 64-bit Windows 7 systems, based around the P55 chipset.
The iPhone is usually (though not always) recognised, but iTunes then complains that it can't connect to the unit because of an &quot;unknown error&quot;, usually (though again, not always) 0xE8000065.

Expand the Universal Serial Bus controllers section of the tree, right-click each USB Root Hub entry in turn, select Properties &gt; Power Management, and clear &quot;Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power&quot;.

                    <text>SYNCING FEELING: iTunes on Windows 7 won't always see, or sync with, your iPod 6.
Windows 7 themes change your custom icons Windows 7 has some spectacular new themes - there's a great selection at the Microsoft site - but installing them can have one annoying side-effect.
If you've previously changed a system icon like Computer or the Recycle Bin then that could disappear, replaced by the equivalent icon from the theme pack.

                    <text>Ensure that there is enough I/O bandwidth, CPU power, and swap space.
Do not expect, however, that further tuning of the operating system will have a significant effect on application performance.
Changes in the Oracle configuration or in the application are likely to result in a more significant difference in operating system efficiency than simply tuning the operating system.

If you reduce the buffer busy waits by tuning the application, then the number of system calls decreases.

                    <text>* Using Operating System Caches * Memory Usage * Using Operating System Resource Managers 9.1.1 Using Operating System Caches Operating systems and device controllers provide data caches that do not directly conflict with Oracle cache management.
Nonetheless, these structures can consume resources while offering little or no benefit to performance.
This is most noticeable on a UNIX system that has the database files in the UNIX file store; by default, all database I/O goes through the file system cache.

                    <text>On some UNIX systems, direct I/O is available to the filestore.
This arrangement allows the database files to be accessed within the UNIX file system, bypassing the file system cache.
It saves CPU resources and allows the file system cache to be dedicated to non-database activity, such as program texts and spool files.

                    <text>Although the operating system cache is often redundant because the Oracle buffer cache buffers blocks, there are a number of cases where Oracle does not use the Oracle buffer cache.
In these cases, using direct I/O which bypasses the UNIX or operating system cache, or using raw devices which do not use the operating system cache, may yield worse performance than using operating system buffering.
Some examples include:

It can then continue processing.
With asynchronous I/O, processing continues while the I/O request is submitted and processed.
Use asynchronous I/O when possible to avoid bottlenecks.

There is an overhead in processing messages.
When an application generates many messages that need to be sent through the network, the latency of sending a message can result in CPU overload.
To alleviate this problem, bundle multiple messages together rather than perform lots of round trips.
For example, you can use array inserts, array fetches, and so on.

                    <text>9.4.4.2.2 Memory-mapped System Timer Oracle often needs to query the system time for timing information.
This can involve an operating system call that incurs a relatively costly context switch.
Some platforms implement a memory-mapped timer that uses an address within the processes virtual address space to contain the current time information.
Reading the time from this memory-mapped timer is less expensive than the overhead of a context switch for a system call.

                    <text>Introduced at PODC 2000 by Eric Brewer 5 and formally proven by Seth Gilbert and Nancy Lynch in 2002 6 , the CAP Theorem, in particular, stipulates that it is impossible for a distributed system to be simultaneously:Consistent, Available, and Partition-Tolerant.
At any given time, only two of these three desirable properties can be achieved.
Hence when building distributed systems, design tradeoffs must be made.

                    <text>Eventually Consistent Solutions Are Not Always Viable Driven by awareness of CAP limitations, a popular design approach for scaling Web-oriented applications is to anticipate that large-scale systems will inevitably encounter network partitions and to thereforerelax consistency in order to allow services to remain highly available even as partitions occur 7 .
Rather than go down and interrupt user service upon network outages, many Web user applications—e.g., customer shopping carts, email search, social network queries—can tolerate stale data and adequately merge conflicts, possibly guided by help from end users once partitions are fixed.
Several so-calledeventually consistent platforms designed for partition-tolerance and availability—largely inspired by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft—are available as products, cloud-based services, or even derivative, open source community projects.

                    <text>Business rules do not permit relaxed consistency, so invariants like account trading balances must be enforced by strong transactional consistency semantics.
In application terms, the cost of anapology 8 makes rollback too expensive, so many high-speed financial applications must limit workflow exposure traditionally by relying onOLTP systems with ACID guarantees.

                    <text>Our Solution: The EDF Any choice of distributed system design—shared memory, shared-disk, or shared-nothing architecture—has inescapableCAP tradeoffs with downstream implications on data correctness and concurrency.
High-level design choices also impact throughput and latency as well as programmability models, potentially imposing constraints on schema flexibility and transactional semantics.

By simply connecting more machine nodes, theEDF scales data storage horizontally.
Within a data partition (not to be confused with network partitions), data entries are key/value pairs with thread-based, read-your-writes7 consistency.

                    <text>The isolation of data into partitions creates a service-oriented design pattern where related partitions can be grouped into abstractions calledservice entities 11 .
A service entity is deployed on a single machine at a time where it owns and manages a discrete collection of data—a holistic chunk of the overall business schema—hence, multiple data entries colocated within a service entity can be queried and updated transactionally, independent of data within another service entity.

                    <text>Mining The Gap In C-A-P From a CAP perspective, service entities enable the EDF to exploit a well-known approach to fault tolerance based onpartial-failure modes, fault isolation, and graceful degradation of service 12 .
Service entities allow application designers to demarcate units of survivability in the face of network faults.
So rather than striving for complete partition-tolerance (an impossible result) when consistency and availability must be prioritized, theEDF implements arelaxed, weakened form of partition-tolerance that isolates the effects of network failuresenabling the maximum number of services to remain fully consistent and available when network splits occur.

                    <text>By configuring membership roles (reflecting service entity responsibilities) for each member of the distributed system, customers can orthogonally (in a lightweight, non-invasive, declarative manner) encode business semantics that give theEDF the ability to decide under what circumstances a member node can safely continue operating after a disruption caused by network failure.
Membership roles perform application decomposition by encapsulating the relationship of one system member to another, expressing causal data dependencies, message stability rules (defining what attendant members must be reachable), loss actions (what to do if required roles are absent), and resumption actions (what to do when required roles rejoin).

                    <text>For example, membership roles can identify independent subnetworks in a complex workflow application.
So long as interdependent producer and consumer activities are present after a split, reads and writes to their data partitions can safely continue.
Rather than arbitrarily disabling an entire losing side during network splits, theEDF consults fine-grained knowledge of service-based role dependencies and keeps as many services consistently available as possible.

For example, in an e-commerce site, acquisition of shopping cart items is prioritized as a high-write availability scenario, i.e., an e-retailer wants shopping cart data to be highly available even at the cost of weakened consistency, lest service interruption stalls impulse purchases, or worse yet, ultimately forces customers to visit competitor store fronts.

                    <text>Once items are placed in the shopping cart and the order is clicked, automated order fulfillment workflows re-prioritize for data consistency (at the cost of weakened availability) since no live customer is waiting for the next Web screen to appear; if an activity blocks, another segment of the automated workflow can be alternatively launched, or the activity can be retried.
In addition to changingCAP requirements, data mutability requirements also change—e.g., at the front end of a workflow, data may be write-intensive; whereas afterward, during bulk processing, the same captured data may be accessed in read-only or read-mostly fashion.

For example, theEDF exploits many-corethread-level parallelism by managing entries in highly concurrent data structures and utilizing service pools for computation and network I/O.
The EDF employspartitioned and pipelined parallelism to perform distributed queries, aggregation, and internal distribution operations on behalf of user applications.

Similarly, business data schemas and workloads frequently consist of multi-step operations on uniform (e.g., sequential time series) data streams.
These operations can be composed into parallel data flow graphs where the output of one operator is streamed into the input of another; hence multiple operators can work continuously in task pipelines.

For example, a financial risk analytics application can colocate all trades, risk sensitivities, and reference data associated with a single instrument in the same region.
Using the FunctionService, control flow can then be directly routed to specific nodes holding particular data sets; hence queries can be localized and then aggregated in parallel increasing the speed of execution when compared to a distributed query.

If application requests do not find data in the client cache, the data is automatically fetched from theEDF by the server.
As modifications to shared regions occur, these updates areautomatically pushed to clients where applications receive realtime event notifications.
Likewise, modifications initiated by a client application are sent to the server and then pushed to other applications listening for region updates.

                    <text>When network faults inevitably occur, failures can be contained; service does not disappear wholesale, but degrades gracefully in a partial manner.
Our solution also lets designers apply varying combinations of consistency, availability, and partition-tolerance at different times and locations in a business workflow.

                    <text>Hence, by tuningCAP semantics, a data solutions architect can amortize partition outage risks across the entire workflow, thus maximizing consistency with availability while minimizing disruption windows caused by network partitions.
This configurability ultimately enables architects to build an optimal, high performance data management solution capable of scaling with business growth and deployment topologies.

                    <text>From an functional viewpoint, the EDF is a memory-centric distributed system for business-wide caching, distribution, and analysis of operational data.
It lets businesses run faster, reliably, and more intelligently by co-locating entire enterprise working data sets in memory, rather than constantly fetching this data from high-latency disk.

                    <text>The EDF melds the functionality of scalable database management, messaging, and stream processing into holistic middleware for sharing, replicating, and querying operational data across process, machine, andLAN/WAN boundaries.
To applications, theEDF appears as a single, tightly interwoven, overlay mesh that can expand and stretch elastically to match the size and shape of a growing enterprise.
And unlike single-purpose, poll-driven, key-value stores, theEDF is a live platform—realtime Web infrastructure—that automatically pushes events to applications based on continuous mining of data streams—giving enterprise customers instant insight to perishable opportunities.

                    <text>Extension: AJAX AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML , technologies that can be used on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications.
With AJAX, web applications can send data to, and retrieve data from, a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.
Examples of this might be receiving a new email in your web based mail client without having to refresh the page manually, another example is a breaking news article appearing on a news site without you having to refresh the page.Web 2.0 sites make heavy use of AJAX and data is usually retrieved using theXMLHttpRequest API.

The computer then willingly follows that exact command, informing the user of the its progress.
For example, the user may want to type in the command to print a document.
The user will type the statementPrint, then the name of the Printer and finally the name of the file to be printed:

The maximum number of colours that can be used are called the Graphics.
This User interface will display a Main window (also known as the Desktop) which then can be accompanied by more windows.

This type of UI is best for users lacking in computer coding skills, since GUI only needs you to make use of the mouses events.
There are still some people who prefer the use of a Command Line Interface to a Graphical User Interface.

E.A.D.M.03-08-2010, 01:04 PMSince I'm using Win7 64 bit, I gotta say, this explains a lot.
The game has been acting very strangely since I got this.

I've actually never faced any problem in the game single nor multiplayer that would seem suspicious, besides the few multiplayer connection bugs that everyone else have.

I've written because, of course not a problem of 64-bit system.
There are thousands of configurations of computers in the world, yours probably has bugs, or have a program that causes errors with the game.
Deltra03-08-2010, 02:31 PMI have a Dell, recently upgraded to Windows 7 64 bit, with a Geforce 8600M, and so far the game is running just fine.
Not running dual monitors though, so also can't comment on that.

I'm not doubting your claim, just suggesting that this maybe isn't the right explanation.

DrSuperGood03-08-2010, 03:10 PMThe whole compatibility problem with 32 in 64 bit OS was because XP 64 was not particually that good (which resulted in such claims).

                    <text>The only real compatibility problem is that 64 bit OS need 64 bit drivers for some hardware which do not exist (in the case of old or no longer supported harware).
Next to that, from my experinece 64 bit OS are identical to their 32 bit counterparts but with additional functionality like support for 64 bit executables (generally faster than 32 bit for some tasks).

                    <text>There is a high chance that the problems you are reporting might occur even on 32 bit OS versions.
There is also a high chance that the cause is due to driver problems (the game is getting unexpected feedback from drivers).
Buttons 03-08-2010, 03:36 PMI think the main point of this thread is that Square Enix support is just grabbing at straws trying to get out of providing support for their product.

I contacted Codemasters, they apologized and even told me to ask for a refund from my retailer and they admitted the box art was deceptive.

The point is that even though the company doesn't recommend it with 64-bit Windows, it has worked in previous games and it works in this game for other people, so the problem is NOT the 64-bit OS, but the OP's individual system so the thread title is wrong. gpgsteve 03-08-2010, 04:12 PMHi there.

Supreme Commander 2 does work with 64-bit OSes; many of us here are using them.
There is no specific support for 64-bit, i.e. an actual 64-bit executable.

It's a cop-out.
I've seen a lot of pieces of software that do not support Windows 7 or Vista.
Vista had been out 6 months and a lot of games and other software had no official Vista support, so they just told the Vista owners to take a walk.

As this gap narrows, game publishers aren't going to be able to pull this without being exposed and taking heat.
LA Snow03-08-2010, 04:31 PMI think I failed to mention that the game runs fine on my 64bit OS.
The game fails to launch after the second adapter is enabled.

LA Snow03-08-2010, 08:04 PMI've heard of people contacting their credit card companies about charge backs.
Be completely honest to ensure you don't violate any laws, but if a PC game is sold without proper documentation on the box, or fails to function, then I think it's legal to have your credit card company do a charge back which forcibly removes money from the retailers account and back into your own.

This itself might be open to legal action as if the credit card company legally and rightfully (assuming all is legal and right, I don't really know) performs a charge back for a defective product, and then steam locks your account, then Steam has locked your account even though you've operated within the law.
You'd need a lawyer of course.
This is all hear-say, I know nothing about this first hand.

You file a report with your bank and indicate the situation.
They move forward and contact Visa or Mastercard who reimburses them, and in turn, takes money away from the merchant.
The bank and the merchant both have agreements they have to accept in order to have the Visa or Mastercard logo present on the cards, and to accept them in the store.

I don't see how this does not violate their Visa or Mastercard agreement.
My assumption is that they allow the chargeback and if Visa or MC takes the money, then Steam has to release it, but then they kick in the subscriber agreement about how it can be terminated at any time.

Normally a business accepting Visa and MC are held to certain standards.
If they fail to meet these standards, then they are not allowed to accept credit cards and must only accept things like PayPal.

Remember that next time someone asks for your drivers licence just because you used a Visa.

Spikx03-09-2010, 12:37 PMPeople, the issue here is, that he can't enable the secondary video adapter, not that he can't run the game at all.
This might as well be an issue with DirectX or the GPU driver he is using.
Being able to use the second video adapter depends heavily on that, not just on the implementation of the application using it.

                    <text>Btw.The game was advertised as working with dual monitors and it was never mentioned that the OS needed to be 32bit.there are other factors as well that contribute to whether or not you will be able to use the secondary video adapter.
For example, up until recently, NVidia drivers did not allow using the secondary video adapter by 3D applications when running in SLI mode.
Apparently they finally improved on that in the recent driver version (which were nuked by them again, since there is a serious bug in the latest 2 driver version, which could cause your NVidia GPU to simply of heat ;)).

Supreme Commander 2 does work with 64-bit OSes; many of us here are using them.
There is no specific support for 64-bit, i.e. an actual 64-bit executable.

Dual-monitor (and I think in the OP's case, the issue is tied to Eyefinity) issues notwithstanding, any chance you can run the flag up the pole with Squeenix and get their support to stop looking for reasons not to provide support?
Doesn't Microsoft have something in place where if you're getting the Win7 logo, you are supporting both flavors of 7?

Thanks!

Inorder for the statement to be valid that the 64 bit OS have problem with multi screen support, the same computers using the same hardware and same drivers need to run a 32 bit OS to check if it works then.
As a rough guess there is a very high chance that the same multi monitor support issues may exist for both 32 and 64 bit OS versions unless the bug is caused by the display drivers in which case it is not the problem of the game developers and infact is the problem of the hardware supplier.

The game however was designed for 32 bit OS and as 64 bit OS generally have perfect 32 bit support, this is not a problem.

                    <text>I agree that the rude support message was agrivating, but in the end the truth is that this game was not designed specifically for 64 bit OS as there is no 64bit executable.
The game however was designed for 32 bit OS and as 64 bit OS generally have perfect 32 bit support, this is not a problem.

                    <text>In short, you can not say 64 bit OS have problems with this game unless you try and prove that the problem is fixed when running the exact same PC with exact same drivers (this is about the only place compatibility issues occur as they are not always the same) except using a 32 bit OS of the same type.

That &quot;tech support&quot; answer was basically a cop-out. koreanbear03-10-2010, 12:39 AMSpeaking of Visa terms.
One of them is that retailers cannot require anything but a signature to verify your Visa purchase.
Remember that next time someone asks for your drivers licence just because you used a Visa.
Just a side note.

                    <text>On topic: I will be trying this out myself this weekend.
I am currently running Win7 64 with an ATI 5770 with the 10.2 drivers as well.
Getting a 32 inch HDtv to replace my 24 inch monitor as my main.
If this works my battle map will be at a 1920 X 1200 res while my game will run at 1920 X 1080.
If it doesn't I am pretty sure it is the drivers or an eyefinity issue.

We live in fraudulent times so if it is such an inconvenience for you to show your ID they will think you stole the card.

That is true but they still have the product to sell again to someone presenting a safer transaction to them.
If they sell the merchandise in hopes the CC is good and it gets chargedback, They are out of money overall instead of in the short term.

The OS knows if a program can be executed in 64 bit, like stated by someone else.
If its not, then windows is 100% capable of running it in 32 bit.
If you examine your program files folder, you will see Program Files, and Program files (x86). everything thats 32 bit (will by default) install here.

Yes it should be require and there should be some form on digital signature online created, I have been a victim of credit card theft (somehow) and it cost me nearly 200 dollars.
Granted i did get this money back but before this, I said 'this will never happen to me' well it can happen to anyone, I can assure you that. suprimos03-10-2010, 09:53 AMuntil now it works good for me with win 7 64bit ultimate Aesir Rising03-10-2010, 10:28 AM But, I would like someone to elaborate that when companies use the Windows 7 logo, it means they support both 32 and 64 bit platforms.

I say Meh! to you sirrah! :cool: soulstrom54403-10-2010, 06:47 PMI have Vista Home Premium and it works fine.
If you get rid of the beta version of steam it works great.
Bogdanzeborsky03-10-2010, 06:53 PMIt's 2010, it might be time to start focusing on 64bit OS support as the main OS, rather than 32bit.

If it works, good for you.
If it does not work then &quot;best effort&quot; support is given.
The solution given by support may ultimately end up being: &quot;move to a supported platform&quot; If a bug is found it is unlikly to be fixed.

Good for you that it works but this does not mean that those that are having trouble are merely the victims of user error.

Sir_Brizz03-11-2010, 10:41 AMI would love to know the likelihood that this game was developed on 32-bit systems on 32-bit OSes.
I think the chances of that are extremely remote.
I've been to some rinky dink tiny developers, and even they are running 64 bit OSes on computers they had built for them by an outside company.

Having worked in support for ages, I can say that most support divisions are encouraged to find a reason they shouldn't help you to keep their response times low and their stats high.

Really the game is just plain buggy and unfinished with a lot of patches to come im sure.
Each person seems to experience their own issues sometimes independent of others with the same hardware setup.
I'm using Win7 Pro 64-bit, AMD 940BE Quadcore, 4gb ram, GTX260, and experience no problems at all.

Smooth gameplay, but many of the same general issues others encounter.
Sorry for all experiencing problems but give it a few months of refining and I think we'll see a much better SupCom2.
I don't think a single person on the Dev team could deny they sold and marketed what is basically a late stage beta game.

1600 isnt officially supported by amd processors and only runs stable with overclocked voltages.Even if run at the higher voltages you might still end up with problems..

Aesir Rising03-14-2010, 06:34 PMCronus, it's a long topic but most of the posts are akin to &quot;I have 7x64 it runs fine&quot;.
But it's been pointed out that folks are just having issues with dual-monitor support and perhaps Eyefinity.
I have neither so I only have skimmed those topics here and at ati.com's catalyst forum.

Xenocat06-02-2010, 01:56 PMI've run this on win764 and vista64 with no problems what so ever. i did notice tho, that the only way to run w/ dual monitor enabled in game is to NOT run in window mode.
The game wont allow dual monitor support when the client is set to windowed for some reason. cygnus x06-02-2010, 08:13 PMwin7 pro 64bit gigabyte p35-dq6 intel Q9550 (2.8ghz) 8gb ram (4x2gb) 8800 ultra &amp; 210 (driver 256 beta) onboard audio (realtech)

Gah, might as well delete it now.
DeathRay2K06-04-2010, 03:29 PMYou probably don't need to, SupCom2 runs just fine on 64-bit Windows.
There's obviously something else wrong with loki's setup.

Yesterday, I purchased couple of games from Steam that included Supreme Commander 2.
The SC2 will not run.
I have total of 25 PC games, ranging from Doom3 to Crysis series.

I tried to debug this SC2 crap PC game from Steam.
Other than generating crash dump files, the Supreme Commander 2 will not run at all.
And the crash dumps tell me crap as well, because I know what causes it, without reading all this:

They all do but not SC2!DX 9.0c != DX 9.0c.
While other games may rund with older version of DX 9.0c, Supreme Commander 2 needs at least the August 2009 version.
Which you should have anyway, since the install script of Steam installs it on the first run, so that's probably not your issue, but who knows.

Just open a thread with a detailed problem description (i.e. when exactly does it crash, do you run it through Steam or via the .exe directly, etc.) and post a dxdiag there (preferably paste it on pastebin.com and post a link, don't paste the dxdiag directly, it's a bit annoying ;)).

It is very likely that you assume your DX10/11 updates actually include the DX9 updates that are required for this DX9-based game, and there is no evidence to the contrary, since you are unwilling to provide a DXDiag for us to analyze.

LA Snow06-05-2010, 11:01 AMHasn't GPG come out and said that SE made a mistake, that 64 bit is supported?
I saw one of the GPG guys come on a thread and say that. sorian06-05-2010, 12:57 PMNot sure what SE's stance is, but since a good majority of our dev machines are 64 bit I don't see why it wouldn't run on a 64-bit OS.

Mabey because I use AMD....I don't know. truescot06-06-2010, 11:15 AMonce again the start of this post was complaing that there was no support provided by square enix for an issue with the game on that specific computer due to the fact that that it had an x64 OS He did not say that it will not run on any x64 machine.

Instead of writing 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, I used 5! whichelicits the same result.
Looking back our definition of why recursion is used, we seem to solve big problems by solving smaller instances of the same problem, so factorials are ripe for recursion:

This trace table will be different from the ones that you have built before as we are going to have to use a stack.

Now what do we do?
We'll soon have two values of n, one for Function call 1 and one for Function call 2.
Using the trace table as a stack (with the bottom of the stack at the top and the top of the stack at the bottom) we'll save all the data about the function call including its value of n and make note of what line we need to return to when we have finished with factorial(3).

What line do we go to next?
As we are treating our trace table as a stack we'll just pop the previous value off the top and look at the last function call we stored away, that is function call 3, factorial(2), and we even know what line to return to, line 3:

Therefore factorial(2) returns 2 * 1 = 2 Function call n Return Line Return Value 1 4 3 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 4 1 1 Again we'll pop the last function call from the stack leaving us with function call 2, factorial(3) and line 3.

Therefore factorial(4) returns 4 * 6 = 24 Function call n Return Line Return Value 1 4 3 24 2 3 3 6 3 2 3 2 4 1 1 We reach the end of function call 1.
But where do we go now?
There is nothing left on the stack and we have finished the code.
Therefore the result is 24.

Fibonacci number example Fibonacci numbers are found in nature and have fascinated mathematicians for centuries Another good example is a method to calculate theFibonacci numbers .
By definition, the first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.:

Recursion summary Recursion does have some issues though, consider how much data we had to store on the stack for just 4 function calls.
If we were to perform 1000, the memory used would be incredibly large.

                    <text>  Recently, a non-programmer friend pointed out that there is no simple explanation of capabilities available on the web.
Less than a week later, another friend -- this one a senior operating system developer for a major UNIX software company -- said to me that he really didn't understand what I was working on (capabilities).
If neither the lay reader nor the experts understand what these things are, an introductory description isdefinitely needed, so I set out to write one.

                    <text>I quickly discovered that doing so isn't easy.
Capabilities themselves are very simple, but they turn everything people &quot;know&quot; about security upside down.
A lot of people look at them and say &quot;this is too simple to possibly work.&quot;

                    <text>This essay is a basic introduction to capabilities and capability-based systems.
Rather than try to give an exhaustive discussion, I have taken some editorial liberties in the interest of clarity:

My goal here is to get across the core of an idea rather than to give every detail precisely.
There are a number of places to go to get more detailed information.

                    <text>* This essay is partisan.
I have chosen to talk about one particular style of capability system.
I think it's the best one, but others are worth looking at if you get a hankering to do so.
If you get to the point of comparing capability systems, you are past the point of askingwhat they are and are now askinghow they should be implemented.
That, however, is a subject for a different essay.

                    <text>This essay will tell you what the term access control covers, what a capability is, and provide some examples of how capabilities can be used to provide flexible access to objects without giving up security.
I'll describe some problems that currently popular access control mechanisms cannot handle.
I'll talk about the problem ofrevoking access, and how this is solved.
Finally, I'll give my own opinion on how capabilities came to be rejected by mainstream computing people.

                    <text>1.  The Problem: Access Control The basic problem of computer security is to control which objects a given program can access, and in what ways.
Objects are things like files, sound cards, other programs, the network, your modem, and so forth.
Access means what kind of operations can be done on these objects.
Examples include reading a file, writing to a file, creating or deleting objects, communicating with another program, etc.

I should not be able to read your medical records, for example.
You should not be able to delete my work.
This is the what most people mean when they talk about computer security.

                    <text>Limiting access.
You want to ensure that a program or a user doesn't do more than you mean them to.
For example, you might want to run a program off of the Web but prevent the program from reading or writing any files so that it cannot plant a computer virus or give away your private phone book.
This issue has been getting more attention lately with all of the hype around Java.

                    <text>Granting access.
You may want to allow two people to work together on a document or to grant access to a particular file to someone else so that you can delegate a job to them.
Note however, that you probably want to do this selectively.
Just because we are working on a business plan together doesn't mean that I should get to read your medical records.
From a practical perspective, this is just as important as the first two, but security people don't tend to think about it very much.

In computers, people do not access objects; programs do.
This distinction has practical importance for several reasons:

                    <text>2.  What a Capability Is The term capability was introduced by Dennis and Van Horn in 1966 in a paper entitledProgramming Semantics for Multiprogrammed Computations.
The basic idea is this: suppose we design a computer system so that in order to access an object, a program must have a special token.
This tokendesignates an object and gives the program the authority to perform a specific set of actions (such as reading or writing) on that object.
Such a token is known as a capability.

                    <text>A capability is a lot like the keys on your key ring.
As an example, consider your car key.
It works on a specific car (it designates a particular object), and anyone holding the key can perform certain actions (locking or unlocking the car, starting the car, opening the glove compartment).

                    <text>You can hand your car key to me, after whichI can open, lock, or start the car, but only onyour car.
Holding your car key won't let me test drive my neighbor's Lamborghini (which is just as well -- I would undoubtedly wrap it around a tree somewhere).
Note that the car key doesn't know that it's me starting the car; it's sufficient that I possess the key.
In the same way,capabilities do not care who uses them.

                    <text>Car keys sometimes come in several variations.
Two common ones are the valet key (starts, locks, and unlocks the car, but not the glove compartment) or the door key (locks/unlocks the car, but won't start it).
In exactly this way, two capabilities can designate the same object(such as the car) but authorize different sets of actions.
One program might hold a read-only capability to a file while another holds a read-write capability to the same file.

A rescinded capability conveys no authority to do anything at all.

In such a system, every program holds a set of capabilities.
If program A holds a capability to talk to program B, then the two programs can grant capabilities to each other.

                    <text>In most capability systems, a program can hold an infinite number of capabilities.
Such systems have tended to be slow.
A better design allows each program to hold a fixed (and small -- like 16 or 32) number of capabilities, and provides a means for storing additional capabilities if they are needed.
The only way to obtain capabilities is to have them granted to you as a result of some communication.

The goal is to make the set of capabilities held by each program as specific and as small as possible, because a program cannot abuse authority it does not have.
This is known as theprinciple of least privilege.

If a program is running on behalf of Natasha (my other dog), it can open any of the files that Natasha created.
Such a system is called anaccess control list (ACL) system.

Once they have the capability, they can manipulate the object itself.
This is the purpose of the UNIXopen system call.

                    <text>A Better Solution: Universal Persistence A better solution is not to have a common file system, and not to give any program access to the file system by default.
File systems are very useful, but most programs and subsystems do not need access to them.
A spell checker that runs as part of a word processor, for example, needs access to the particular files it works on, but has no need to open any other files (and therefore no need of access to a file system).

The solution is to simply remembereverything.
Every five minutes, write down all of the things the computer is working on.
If Sheena pulls the plug, the system simply comes back to the last saved copy.
Since the saved copy includes all of the running programs, there is no need to figure out who is entitled to what when the system restarts.

Here are some examples of these problems in today's computer systems, and an explanation of why the problems do not exist in capability systems.

                    <text>Privileged Programs Consider the program that changes your password.
It needs the authority to read and write the password file, but must not give that authority to you.

                    <text>In an ACL system the only way to do this is to have access to the password file restricted to a special user (root or sysadm), and have some means to say that the password program runs as that user.
This has led to ideas such as thesetuid bit (lets a program runs as both the owner [usually root] and as you at the same time) or the system privilege table (VMS: lists programs with special privileges in a system-wide table).

                    <text>Both of these mechanisms are insecure.
Giving the password program all of root's authority is simply too much.
In the VMS mechanism, the program file itself can be attacked, leaving a hard to find security hole.
The next time the program is run it will obey the new program, which can do absolutely anything.

As maintainers alter these programs without fully understanding their constraints, they become sources of new security flaws.

                    <text>The right solution is to explicitly give the program access to the password file, and not leave the password program lying around in a file system where it can be overwritten.
In a capability system, you simply give the program a capability to the password database and let it run forever.
You then give out a capability that lets people run the password program but does not let them read or modify that program.

                    <text>Access Restriction Suppose you have a program that manages your financial data.
You don't really want it sending that information to the IRS without your permission, but your computer is attached to the network.
In an ACL system, since you have access to the network, so does the program.
In a capability system you simply leave the capabilities for the network out when you install the program, guaranteeing that it cannot send data to those helpful, friendly people at the IRS.

                    <text>Java solves this problem by ad-hoc restrictions.
You may have noticed that people keep finding new security problems with Java.
This is because ad-hoc security mechanisms don't work.
It is better to have done the job right in the first place.
Capabilities have a formal, mathematically sound model that can be (and has been) used toprove their security.

                    <text>Collaboration The really hard part, however, is dealing with collaboration.
Suppose I have a secret program that is very valuable.
I'm afraid to give out the binary code, because somebody will decompile it and steal my program (yes, this really does happen).
You have some very secret data concerning the results of a new drug trial.
You need to run my program, but you're not willing to show me the data.

                    <text>In a capability system, we can set things up so that you can run the program without being able to see the code, but you are able to control what authority my program is given.
Since you control the authorities, you can ensure that my program will not tell me your secrets.
Since you cannot gain access to the binary code, you cannot steal the program.
Most computer security experts believe that this is impossible.
In ACL systems, it reallyis impossible.

In many cases this is the best solution.
In capability systems, another solution is possible: build a software-enforced special compartment that prevents the documents from being copied out of the compartment, and only let the user access those documents inside the compartment.

The early capability systems were built in hardware before we knew a lot about hardware architecture, and used capabilities for access to main memory.
This made them terribly slow and terribly complex.
Those systems are a good bit less complex than today's operating systems, but their reputation persists.

We now have examples of microkernels that are significantly faster than conventional operating systems, and at least one example of a capability system that is so.

In fact, computer software vendors have taken steps to ensure that they are not held liable for the flaws in their software, even when they are real, demonstrable, and incontrovertable.
Until this changes, there is no reason to do secure systems.

                    <text>\def\Matrix#1{\left[\;\;\Height\begin{array}{rrrcr}#1\end{array}\;\;\right]} $ Systems of linear equations arise in all sorts of applications in many different fields of study.
The method reviewed here can be implemented to solve a linear system $\begin{array}{ccccccccc} a_{11}x_{1} &amp; + &amp; a_{12}x_{2} &amp; + &amp; \ldots &amp; + &amp; a_{1n}x_{n} &amp; = &amp; b_{1} \\ a_{21}x_{1} &amp; + &amp; a_{22}x_{2} &amp; + &amp; \ldots &amp; + &amp; a_{2n}x_{n} &amp; = &amp; b_{2} \\ \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\ a_{m1}z_{1} &amp; + &amp; a_{m2}x_{2} &amp; + &amp; \ldots &amp; + &amp; a_{mn}x_{n} &amp; = &amp; b_{m} \\ \end{array}$ of any size.
We write this system in matrix form as $$ \left[\begin{array}{cccc} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1n}\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{2n}\\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots\\ a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{mn} \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1\\ x_2\\ \vdots\\ x_n \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} b_1\\ b_2\\ \vdots\\ b_m \end{array} \right] $$ That is, $ A{\bf x} = {\bf b}. $ We can capture all the information contained in the sytem in the singleaugmented matrix $$ \Matrix{ a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1n} &amp; &amp; b_{1}\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{2n} &amp;\|&amp; b_{2}\\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp;\|&amp; \vdots\\ a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{mn} &amp; &amp; b_{m}\\ } $$ We will solve the original system of linear equations by performing a sequence of the following elementary row operations on the augmented matrix:

Do you see how we are manipulating the system of linear equations by applying each of these operations?
When a sequence of elementary row operations is performed on an augmented matrix, the linear system that corresponds to the resulting augmented matrix is equivalent to the original system.

Our strategy in solving linear systems, therefore, is to take an augmented matrix for a system and carry it by means of elementary row operations to an equivalent augmented matrix from which the solutions of the system are easily obtained.
In particular, we bring the augmented matrix to Row-Echelon Form:

                    <text>The augmented matrix $$ A_{2} = \Matrix{ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; &amp; -5\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp;\|&amp; 4\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; 0 } $$ also in reduced row-echelon form, corresponds to the system $\begin{array}{ccrcr} x_1 &amp; &amp; -3x_3 &amp; = &amp; -5\\ &amp; x_2 &amp; +2x_3 &amp; = &amp; 4\\ &amp; &amp; 0 &amp; = &amp; 0 \end{array}$ Letting $x_3=t$, we find that $x_2 = -2t+4$ and $x_1=3t-5$.
Thus, the system has infinitely many solutions, parametrized for all $t$ as $$ \left[\begin{array}{c} x_1\\ x_2\\ x_3 \end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{c} 3t-5\\ -2t+4\\ t \end{array}\right] $$ Finally, the augmented matrix $$ A_{3} = \Matrix{ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; 3\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp;\|&amp; 2\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; &amp; 1 } $$ again in reduced row-echelon form, corresponds to the system $\begin{array}{ccccr} x_1 &amp; &amp; &amp; = &amp; 3\\ &amp; x_2 &amp; &amp; = &amp; 2\\ &amp; &amp; 0 &amp; = &amp; 1 \end{array}$ which clearly has no solution.
The system is inconsistent.

Problems with my Build So throughout this month, I've been buying some new computer parts to upgrade what I have at the moment, but all I've encountered was a string of failures.
I've bought a new mobo, processor, power supply, and a case in the end and the new build doesn't work.

                    <text>I'll type the specs below, but as far as I know things should be working.
I've already replaced the motherboard and the processor to get RMA's but things still aren't working.
I've checked the connector/pin/SATA cable arrangements and they're all in the correct spots.
I'm chalking it up as a defective or incompatible power supply at the moment, but I want to make sure that's the case, so if anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated.

My brother, who's handy with computers, has already done the trick with power supplies to see if electricity is circulating through it and it did work as the fans were spinning when the test was done.
Right now I'm just very disappointed because this is like $260 that has so much potential yet it doesn't work.

Also had to buy new RAM.

                    <text>@green cheese, Power switch is definitely on and all the wires were connected to the motherboard.
I've already replaced the motherboard which took a grueling 3 weeks to complete, but I suppose it is possible that I've gotten a second defective motherboard, quite a pain in the ♥♥♥ if that were the case ..

Only the ephemeral, short-lived caps, num, and scr locks that lit up for one second then blacked out was the response to turning the power supply on.

do you even get a post?

No, I don't know anyone with the same mobo, and I don't know what you mean by your second question but if you're asking if I got any response at all, it's a no.

                    <text>It's a bit heartbreaking if it's the motherboard, though, because that's pretty much another 3 weeks of waiting for a second RMA.
But thanks for the assistance. #7 le'ocean Dec 15, 2012 @ 12:25pm  well not the same mobo but a 1155, what i ment by post was the boot screen bios options.. but like you said you get nothing. #8 &lt;s&gt;2CardBoardBox Dec 15, 2012 @ 2:04pm  Originally posted bygreen cheese :well not the same mobo but a 1155, what i ment by post was the boot screen bios options.. but like you said you get nothing.

Or any other comments or suggestions are of course greatly appreciated. #10 - CJ - [DSS]

                    <text>First Come First Served (FCFS): CPU gets a lot of processes to handle.
The problem is shortening the waiting time for a process to reach CPU and get processed.
Now consider a CPU and also consider a list in which the processes are listed as follows, Arrival Process Burst Time 0 1 3 1 2 2 2 3 1 Here, Arrival is the time when the process has arrived the list, Process Number is used instead of the process name, and Burst Time is the amount of time required by the process from CPU.

                    <text>Well, as the unit of time you can take anything like nano-second, second, minute etc whatever.
We consider it as second.
Now for an instance, consider the above list as the ready queue for the CPU, that is the CPU will take processes from this list and will process it.

                    <text>Here in FCFS, CPU will take the first process in the list and will process it, then it will take the second process and so on.
So this is a very easy thing to do huh !
Ok.

                    <text>So, lets see what CPU is doing, At Time 0s Doing 1s time Unit Job of Process-1, so Process-1 has left 2s Time Unit JobAt Time 1s Doing 1s time Unit Job of Process-1, so Process-1 has left 1s Time Unit JobAt Time 2s Doing 1s time Unit Job of Process-1, so Process-1 has left 0s Time Unit JobAt Time 3s Doing 1s time Unit Job of Process-2, so Process-2 has left 1s Time Unit JobAt Time 4s Doing 1s time Unit Job of Process-2, so Process-2 has left 0s Time Unit JobAt Time 5s Doing 1s time Unit Job of Process-3, so Process-3 has left 0s Time Unit Job We can show the above thing as the following time-line Process-1 Process-1 Process-1 Process-2 Process-2 Process-3 0s 1s 2s 3s 4s 5s A shortened view of the above time-line is as follows,  | Process-1 |  Process-2 |  Process-3 | 0                 3 5 6 So now came the main thing, Waiting Time.
Ok, Look carefully, Process-2 Arrived at the List of Process at 1s with a Burst Time of 2s.
But CPU started processing Process-2 at 3s.

                    <text>So process-2 waited for 2s.
Process-1 Process-1 Process-1 Process-2 Process-2 Process-3 0s 1s 2s 3s 4s 5s But process-1 had not wait because it Arrived at 0s and also the CPU started processing it at 0s.
But Process-3 Arrived at the List of Process at 2s with a Burst Time of 1s.

                    <text>But CPU started processing Process-3 at 5s.
So process-3 waited for 3s.
Process-1 Process-1 Process-1 Process-2 Process-2 Process-3 0s 1s 2s 3s 4s 5s So total waiting time = (Waiting Time of Process-1)+ (Waiting Time of Process-2)                                      + (Waiting Time of Process-3)                                    = (0+2+3)s                                   = 5s So the average waiting time is = (Total waiting time / Number of Processes)s                                                  = (5/3)s                                                  = 1.66s Ok...I think you have understood the thing.

                    <text>Now lets talk about the program.
Input: You will ask the user for the number of processes.
Then for each process you will take its Process Number, Arrival Time and its Burst time.

                <section>
                    <text>You don’t have to worry, the number of processes wont be more than 5 or 6, Arrival time of a process can only be equal or greater than the arrival time of its previous process and Process will be entered as a serial number, so no problem.
Output: In the output you will have to print out the shortened time-line we showed you above.
For example, if the input is as follows, Arrival Process Burst Time 0 1 3 1 2 2 2 3 1 Then the shortened time-line will be,  | Process-1 |  Process-2 |  Process-3 | 0                 3 5 6 You can also print out the time-line vertically if you want (thats what I have done, see the output of my program) Ok beneath this shortened time-line you will have to print a table as follows, Process Arrival Finish Total Wait 1 0 2 3 0 2 1 4 2 2 3 2 5 1 3                                              Beneath this, you will have to show the Average Waiting Time.

                <section>
                    <text>I know you have understood, now see a screen-shot of exactly what I was talking about, Exception: One exception is that, I said “Arrival time of a process can only be equal or greater than the arrival time of its previous process&quot;.
So take a look at the following list of process, Arrival Process Burst Time 0 1 3 55 2 2 60 3 1 You see, the Job of Process-1 will complete at 2s, thus from 3s to 54s the CPU will remain idle.
Again the job of Process-2 will complete at 56s and thus from 57s to 59s the CPU will again remain as idle.

See the following screenshot, You can download my program (.exe only) to try it out.

I am sure you will enjoy it.
However, this is the first program of Process Scheduling and the easiest one.

                    <text>* PARVEEN KUMAR February 7, 2013 at 7:30 AM In the program u should sort Arrival time so that your program will work even if i input in wrong order Reply Delete Replies * Tanmay Chakrabarty February 9, 2013 at 11:03 AM In this program, I wasn't in need to do that as in real case, the arrival time will never come unsorted.
However, thanks for suggestion.

                    <text>Diomidis Spinellis All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection ,&quot; is a famous quote attributed to Butler Lampson, the scientist who in 1972 envisioned the modern personal computer.
The quote rings in my head on various occasions: when I am forced to talk to a secretary instead of the person I wish to communicate with, when I first travel east to Frankfurt in order to finally fly west to Shanghai or Bangalore, and—yes—when I examine a complex system's source code.

                    <text>Let's start this particular journey by considering the problem of a typical operating system that supports disparate filesystem formats.
An operating system may use data residing on its native filesystem, a CD-ROM, or a USB stick.

                <section>
                    <text>These storage devices may, in turn, employ different filesystem organizations: NTFS or ext3fs for a Windows or Linux native filesystem, ISO-9660 for the CD-ROM, and, often, the legacy FAT-32 filesystem for the USB stick.
Each filesystem uses different data structures for managing free space, for storing file metadata, and for organizing files into directories.
Therefore, each filesystem requires different code for each operation on a file (open, read, write, seek, close, delete, and so on).

                    <text>From Code to Pointers I grew up in an era where different computers more often than not had incompatible filesystems, forcing me to transfer data from one machine to another over serial links.
Therefore, the ability to read on my PC a flash card written on my camera never ceases to amaze me.
Let's consider how the operating system would structure the code for accessing the different filesystems.

                    <text>One approach would be to employ aswitch statement for each operation.
Consider as an example a hypothetical implementation of the read system call under the FreeBSD operating system.
Its kernel-side interface would look as follows:

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>int VOP_READ( struct vnode *vp, /* File to read from */ struct uio *uio, /* Buffer specification */ int ioflag, /* I/O-specific flags */ struct ucred *cred) /* User's credentials */ { /* Hypothetical implementation */ switch (vp-&gt;filesystem) { case FS_NTFS: /* NTFS-specific code */ case FS_ISO9660: /* ISO-9660-specific code */ case FS_FAT32: /* FAT-32-specific code */ /* [...] */ } }This approach would bundle together code for the various filesystems, limiting modularity.
Worse, adding support for a new filesystem type would require modifying the code of each system call implementation and recompiling the kernel.
Moreover, adding a processing step to all the operations of a filesystem (for example, the mapping of remote user credentials) would also require the error-prone modification of each operation with the same boilerplate code.

                    <text>As you might have guessed, our task at hand calls for some additional levels of indirection.
Consider how the FreeBSD operating system—a code base I admire for the maturity of its engineering—solves these problems.
Each filesystem defines the operations that it supports as functions and then initializes avop_vector structure with pointers to them.
Here are some fields of thevop_vector structure:

Interestingly, FreeBSD also employs indirection to abstract the read function's arguments.

                    <text>This layering allows a filesystem to offer some services (such as translucent views, compression, and encryption) based on the services of another underlying filesystem.
Two mechanisms work cleverly together to support this feature: one allows a single bypass function to modify the arguments of any vop_vector function, while another allows all undefined vop_vector functions to be redirected to the underlying filesystem layer.

The figure illustrates three file-systems layered on top of one another.
On top lies theumapfs filesystem, which the system administrator mounted in order to map user credentials.
This is valuable if the system where this particular disk was created used different user IDs.
For instance, the administrator might want user ID 1013 on the underlying filesystem to appear as user ID 5325.

Theffs in turn, for most of its operations, relies on the code of the original 4.2 BSD filesystem implementationufs.

                    <text>In the example shown in the figure, most system calls pass through a common bypass function in umapfs that maps the user credentials.
Only a few system calls, such asrename and getattr, have their own implementations in umapfs.
The ffs layer provides optimized implementations of read andwrite; both rely on a filesystem layout that is more efficient than the one employed byufs.

                    <text>Most other operations, such asopen, close, getattr, setatr, and rename, are handled in the traditional way.
Thus, avop_default entry in the ffs vop_vector structure directs all those functions to call the underlyingufs implementations.
For example, aread system call will pass through umapfs_bypass andffs_read, whereas a rename call will pass through umapfs_rename and ufs_rename.

This is a beautiful design pattern that is easily overlooked within the intricacies of the C code required to implement it.

The vop_vector structure also contains a pointer to a bypass function.
This function gets the packed arguments and, after possibly performing some modifications on them (such as, perhaps, mapping user credentials from one administrative domain to another) passes control to the appropriate underlying function for the specific call through thea_desc field.

Unfortunately, in your case, the user and group identifiers on the remote system don't match those used on your computer.
However, by interposing aumapfs filesystem over the actual NFS implementation, we can specify through external files the correct user and group mappings.Figure 17-3, “Routing system calls through a bypass function&quot;

                    <text>From Code to a Domain-Specific Language You may have noticed that some of the code associated with the implementation of the read system call, such as the packing of its arguments into a structure or the logic for calling the appropriate function, is highly stylized and is probably repeated in similar forms for all 52 other interfaces.
Another implementation detail, which we have not so far discussed and which can keep me awake at nights, concerns locking.

                    <text>Therefore, locks are nowadays held over fine-grained objects, such as a user's credentials or a single buffer.
Furthermore, because obtaining and releasing locks can be expensive operations, ideally once a lock is held it should not be released if it will be needed again in short order.
These locking specifications can best be described through preconditions (what the state of a lock must be before entering a function) and postconditions (the state of the lock at a function's exit).

This indirection handles both the redundancy of packing code and the fragile locking requirements.

Instead, a domain-specific language is used to specify the types of each call's arguments and their locking pre- and postconditions.
Such an implementation style always raises my pulse, because the productivity boost it gives can be enormous.

For each argument, the code lists the state of its lock for three instances: when the function is entered, when the function exits successfully, and when the function exits with an error—an elegantly clear separation of concerns.
For example, the preceding specification of theread call indicated that the vp argument should be locked in all three cases.

Although I consider this proliferation of system calls inelegant and against the spirit of Unix, applications programmers seem to depend on them for squeezing every bit of performance out of the Web or database servers they implement.

                    <text>All these calls share some common code.
The FreeBSD implementation introduces indirection through additional functions in order to avoid code duplication.
The functionkern_preadv handles the common parts of the positional system call variants, whilekern_readv handles the remaining two system calls.

                    <text>The functionality common in all four is handled by another function,dofileread.
In my mind, I can picture the joy developers got from factoring out the code common to those functions by introducing more levels of indirection.
I always feel elated if, after committing a refactoring change, the lines I add are less than the lines I remove.

                    <text>The journey from our call to a read function in our user-level program to the movement of a disk head to fetch our data from a platter is a long and tortuous one.
In our description, we haven't considered what happens above the kernel layer ( virtual machines, buffering, data representation), or what happens when a filesystem handles a request (buffering again, device drivers, data representation).

                    <text>Interestingly, there's a pleasant symmetry between the two ends we haven't covered: both involve hardware interfaces (virtual machines, such as the JVM at the top, and real interfaces at the bottom), buffering (to minimize system calls at the top, and to optimize the hardware's performance at the bottom), and data representation (to interact with the user's locale at the top, and to match the physical layer's requirements at the bottom).
It seems that indirection is everywhere we care to cast our eyes.
In the representative chunk we've looked at, nine levels of function calls, two indirections through function pointers, and a domain-specific language provided us with a representative view of its power.

                    <text>We could continue looking at more code examples forever, so it is worth bringing our discussion to an end by noting that Lampson attributes the aphorism that started our exploration (all problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection) to David Wheeler, the inventor of the subroutine.
Significantly, Wheeler completed his quote with another phrase: &quot;But that usually will create another problem.&quot;
Indeed, indirection and layering add space and time overhead, and can obstruct the code's comprehensibility.

                    <text>The time and space overhead is often unimportant, and should rarely concern us.
In most cases, the delays introduced by an extra pointer lookup or subroutine call are insignificant in the greater scheme of things.

                    <text>In fact, nowadays the tendency in modern programming languages is for some operations to always happen through a level of indirection in order to provide an additional measure of flexibility.
Thus, for example, in Java and C#, almost all accesses to objects go through one pointer indirection, to allow for automatic garbage collection.
Also, in Java, almost all calls to instance methods are dispatched through a lookup table, in order to allow inheriting classes to override a method at runtime.

                    <text>Despite these overheads that burden all object accesses and method calls, both platforms are doing fine in the marketplace, thank you very much.
In other cases, compilers optimize away the indirection we developers put in our code.
Thus, most compilers detect cases where calling a function is more expensive than substituting its code inline, and automatically perform this inlining.

                    <text>Then again, when we're operating at the edge of performance, indirection can be a burden.
One trick that developers trying to feed gigabit network interfaces use to speed up their code is to combine functionality of different levels of the network stack, collapsing some layers of abstraction.
But these are extreme cases.

                    <text>On the other hand, the effect that indirection has on the comprehensibility of our code is a very important concern, because over the last 50 years, in contrast to the dizzying increases in CPU speeds, the ability of humans to understand code hasn't improved much.
Therefore, the proponents of agile processes advise us to be especially wary when introducing layering to handle some vague, unspecified requirements we imagine might crop up in the future rather than today's concrete needs.
As Bart Smaalders quipped when discussing performance anti-patterns: &quot;Layers are for cakes, not for software.&quot;

In many cases we will also use POSIX, the portable operating systems interface.
For these examples we will use mainly C as the language.

Typically, exercises and lecturing are somewhat mixed during the instruction sessions as indicated above.
Passing the course is through a final exam, a series of practical exercises for which a report has to be handed in and writing an essay on a research paper.

The written exam will start with a collection of short knowledge oriented questions.
After that has been handed in, the book, and the slides may be used with the remainder of the exam.
It isnot allowed to use anything else, including copies of previous exams and solutions to exercises.
You will find example examinations plus solutions at the bottom of this page.

Operating systems courses and presentations like ours necessarily are a bit high-level in the sense that the detailed operation of a real operating system is not discussed but rather the general issues.
We list here some links that provide much more details on UNIX-related operating systems.

                    <text>In other words, a nonlinear system is any problem where the equation(s) to be solved cannot be written as alinear combination of the unknown variables or functions that appear in it (them).
It does not matter if nonlinear known functions appear in the equations; in particular, adifferential equation is linear if it is linear in the unknown function and its derivatives, even if non linear known functions appear as coefficients.

                    <text>Nonlinear problems are of interest to engineers , physicists and mathematicians because most physical systems are inherently nonlinear in nature.
Nonlinear equations are difficult to solve and give rise to interesting phenomena such aschaos .[1]
Some aspects of the weather (although not the climate ) are seen to be chaotic, where simple changes in one part of the system produce complex effects throughout.
A nonlinear system is notrandom .

Nonlinear algebraic equations Main article: Algebraic equation Main article: Systems of polynomial equations Nonlinear algebraic equations , which are also calledpolynomial equations , are defined by equating polynomials to zero.
For example, For a single polynomial equation, root-finding algorithms can be used to find solutions to the equation (i.e., sets of values for the variables that satisfy the equation).

Nevertheless, in the case of the systems with a finite number of complex solutions, thesesystems of polynomial equations are now well understood and efficient methods exist for solving them.[2]

Nonlinear differential equations A system of differential equations is said to be nonlinear if it is not alinear system .
Problems involving nonlinear differential equations are extremely diverse, and methods of solution or analysis are problem dependent.
Examples of nonlinear differential equations are theNavier–Stokes equations in fluid dynamics, theLotka–Volterra equations in biology.

                    <text>One of the greatest difficulties of nonlinear problems is that it is not generally possible to combine known solutions into new solutions.
In linear problems, for example, a family oflinearly independent solutions can be used to construct general solutions through thesuperposition principle .

It is often possible to find several very specific solutions to nonlinear equations, however the lack of asuperposition principle prevents the construction of new solutions.

The equation is nonlinear because it may be written as and the left-hand side of the equation is not a linear function of u and its derivatives.
Note that if theu2 term were replaced with u, the problem would be linear (theexponential decay problem).

Partial differential equations See also: List of nonlinear partial differential equations The most common basic approach to studying nonlinearpartial differential equations is to change the variables (or otherwise transform the problem) so that the resulting problem is simpler (possibly even linear).
Sometimes, the equation may be transformed into one or moreordinary differential equations , as seen in separation of variables , which is always useful whether or not the resulting ordinary differential equation(s) is solvable.

                    <text>Another common (though less mathematic) tactic, often seen in fluid and heat mechanics, is to usescale analysis to simplify a general, natural equation in a certain specificboundary value problem .
For example, the (very) nonlinearNavier-Stokes equations can be simplified into one linear partial differential equation in the case of transient, laminar, one dimensional flow in a circular pipe; the scale analysis provides conditions under which the flow is laminar and one dimensional and also yields the simplified equation.

                    <text>Illustration of a pendulum Linearizations of a pendulum A classic, extensively studied nonlinear problem is the dynamics of apendulum under influence ofgravity .
Using Lagrangian mechanics , it may be shown[ 3] that the motion of a pendulum can be described by thedimensionless nonlinear equation where gravity points &quot;downwards&quot; and is the angle the pendulum forms with its rest position, as shown in the figure at right.

This &quot;solution&quot; generally does not have many uses because most of the nature of the solution is hidden in thenonelementary integral (nonelementary even if).

                    <text>Another way to approach the problem is to linearize any nonlinearities (the sine function term in this case) at the various points of interest through Taylor expansions .
For example, the linearization at, called the small angle approximation, is since for .
This is a simple harmonic oscillator corresponding to oscillations of the pendulum near the bottom of its path.
Another linearization would be at, corresponding to the pendulum being straight up:

The solution to this problem involves hyperbolic sinusoids , and note that unlike the small angle approximation, this approximation is unstable, meaning that will usually grow without limit, though bounded solutions are possible.
This corresponds to the difficulty of balancing a pendulum upright, it is literally an unstable state.

A very useful qualitative picture of the pendulum's dynamics may be obtained by piecing together such linearizations, as seen in the figure at right.
Other techniques may be used to find (exact)phase portraits and approximate periods.
