Like the number of times that the words need to be rotated isn't really X it's X % number of words.

The author makes some misleading statements (especially regarding ArrayList resize behavior) and omits some key points (some of which were admittedly filled in by Stephen Colebourne in the blog comments). – David Citron Jan 22 '12 at 21:12 @DavidCitron can you point to some blog/article that includes the discussion of all the bulletted points in your answer below. – Geek Jul 19 '12 at 13:13 up vote 10 down vote Once when I was interviewing for Microsoft in college, the guy asked me how to detect a cycle in a linked list.

I assume they cared more about how you would come up with the answer, rather than the answer itself, optimal or not. – Terry Li Oct 7 '11 at 18:33 4   I would say, hash the address of the nodes,and put them in map. if you encounter a node that has already been mapped. bingo!.

Where current moves from (next to start to end) and start moves between start and current.

If next encounters null, there is no cycle if ever next is equal to start, then we have a cycle –  fayyazkl May 28 '12 at 6:05 Here's an option for an out of the box solution - lets say that you know you can iterate over the list at some rate (# nodes/sec) and know how much memory is allocated to this list and sizeof the nodes, then you should get to the end of the list within a time proprotional to the ratio of those two, so stopwatch it.

Both of these are easy enough to be doable in a short time, and difficult enough to eliminate the clueless.

I'm sure that ideal for your work, but where I work if you answered that question with a regex solution that would be considered very bad.

Context is important, even for such simple problems. – jheriko Mar 7 '10 at 15:33 1   I'm looking for efficient use of the white board and my time in the interview.
Agreed regex's are not for most things.
For such a contrived example, would you really place runtime constraints like that?
In general .net where my expertise lies, you aren't scrutinizing your code to the clock cycle.

A lot of it tends to come down to whether or not the candidate knows the shortest path and graph traversal algorithms, is familiar with cycle types and detection, and whether they know the complexity bounds.
I think a lot of questions about this stuff comes down to trivia more than on the spot creative thinking ability.

                    <text>I like the Project Euler problem that asks to find the most expensive path down a tree (16/67); common ancestor is a good warm up, but a lot of people have seen it.
Asking somebody to design a tree class, perform traversals, and then figure out from which traversals they could rebuild a tree also gives some insight into data structure and algorithm implementation.
The Stern-Brocot programming challenge is also interesting and quick to develop on a board ( http://online-judge.uva.es/p/v100/10077.html ).

Yeah, if you know what you're doing it is trivial.
But a lot of programmers don't know how to tackle it.

Since data structures is core programming concept, its mandatory for all programmers, to know basic data structures like stack, linked list, queue, array, tree and graph.
Though tree and graph are on tough side, I still see programmers to get familiar will all these.

                    <text>Any list of programming job interview questions isincomplete without questions from data structures and algorithms.
Similarly while going on questions from data structure you may get some programming exercise as well e.g. swapping numbers without temp variable .Linked list and arrays are favorite topics in any data structure interview, questions like reversing linked list, traversing linked list or deleting nodes from linked list, which involves algorithm and data structures are quite common.
Similarly, finding duplicates in array, finding missing numbers, sorting arrays are very popular.

                    <text>Data Structures and Algorithm Interview Questions for Java Programmers This is combined list of questions from various data structure e.g. array, linked list, stack or queue.
It includes some coding questions as well, which gel with data structures.  Question 1 : How to find middle element of linked list in one pass?

                <section>
                    <text>One of the most popular question from data structures and algorithm, mostly asked on telephonic interview.
Since many programmer know that, in order to find length of linked list we need to first traverse through linkedlist till we find last node, which is pointing to null, and then in second pass we can find middle element by traversing only half of length.

                <section>
                    <text>They get confused when interviewer ask him to do same job in one pass.
In order to find middle element of linked list in one pass you need to maintain two pointer, one increment at each node while other increments after two nodes at a time, by having this arrangement, when first pointer reaches end, second pointer will point to middle element of linked list.

                <section>
                    <text>See this trick to find middle element of linked list in single pass for more details.
Question 2 : How to find if linked list has loop ?
This question has bit of similarity with earlier algorithm and data structure interview question.

                    <manualLabel>1</manualLabel>
                    <svmLabel>0</svmLabel>

                    <wordAbsenceFeature>0.0</wordAbsenceFeature>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>I mean we can use two pointer approach to solve this problem.
If we maintain two pointers, and we increment one pointer after processing two nodes and other after processing every node, we are likely to find a situation where both the pointers will be pointing to same node.
This will only happen if linked list has loop.
Question 3 : How to find 3rd element from end in a linked list in one pass?
This is another frequently asked linked list interview question.

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>This question is exactly similarto finding middle element of linked list in single pass .If we apply same trick of maintaining two pointers and increment other pointer, when first has moved upto 3rd element, than when first pointer reaches to the end of linked list, second pointer will be pointing to the 3rd element from last in a linked list.
Question 4 : In an integer array, there is 1 to 100 number, out of one is duplicate, how to find ?

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>This is a rather simple data structures question, especially for this kind of.
In this case you can simply add all numbers stored in array, and total sum should be equal ton(n+1)/2.
Now just subtract actual sum to expected sum, and that is your duplicate number.

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>Of course there is a brute force way of checking each number against all other numbers, but that will result in performance of O(n&lt;s&gt;2) which is not good.
By the way this trick will not work if array have multiple duplicates or its not numbers forming arithmetic progression.
Here is example of one wayto find duplicate number in array .

                <section>
                    <text>This is one of my favorite question.
SinceString is one of the most important type in programming, you expect lot of question related to String any data structure interview.

                <section>
                    <text>There are many ways to reverse Sting in Java or any other programming language, and interviewer will force you to solve this problem by using without API i.e. without usingreverse() method of StringBuffer.
In follow-up he may ask to reverse String using recursion as well.

                <section>
                    <text>Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithm but if you ask anyone to implement on the spot it gives you an opportunity to gauge programming skills of a candidate.
See How to sort array using Bubble Sort in Java forcomplete solution of this datastrucutre interview question.
Question 8 : What is difference between Stack and Queue data structure ?

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>One of the classical datastrucutre interview question.
I guess every one know, No?
Any way main difference is that Stack is LIFO(Last In First Out) data structure while Queue is a FIFO(First In First Out) data structure.
Question 9 : How do you find duplicates in array if there is more than one duplicate?
Sometime this is asked as follow-up question of earlier datastrucutre interview question, related to finding duplicates in Array.

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>One way of solving this problem is usinga Hashtable or HashMap datastructure.
You can traverse through array, and store each number as key and number of occurrence as value.
At the end of traversal you can find all duplicate numbers, for which occurrence is more than one.
In Java if a number already exists in HashMap then calling get(index) will return number otherwise it return null. this property can be used to insert or update numbers inHashMap.

                    <text>Question 10 : What is difference between Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List data structure?
This is another classical interview question on data structure, mostly asked on telephonic rounds.

                <section>
                    <text>Main difference between singly linked list and doubly linked list is ability to traverse.
In a single linked list, node only points towards next node, and there is no pointer to previous node, which means you can not traverse back on a singly linked list.
On the other hand doubly linked list maintains two pointers, towards next and previous node, which allows you to navigate in both direction in any linked list.

Interviewer is often interested in two things, a function which returns nth number in Fibonacci series and solving this problem using recursion in Java.
Though, its easy question, recursion part often confuses beginners.

Question 12 : Write Java program to check if a number is palindrome or not?
This is similar to previous question, not directly related to data structures, but quite popular along with other questions.
A number is called palindrome, if reverse of number is equal to number itself.
Interviewer ask to solve this problem without taking help from Java API or any open source library.

                <section>
                    <text>Any way it’s simple question, you can use division operator (/) and remainder operator (%) to solve this question.
Just remember, division operator can be used to get rid of last digit e.g. 1234/10 will give you 123, and modulus operator can give you last digit e.g. 1234%10 will return 4.
By the way, here isa Java program check if number is palindrome or not .
Question 13 : What is binary search tree?
This is a data structure question from Tree data structures.

                <section>
                    <text>Binary Search Tree has some special properties e.g. left nodes contains items whose value is less than root , right sub tree contains keys with higher node value than root, and there should not be any duplicates in the tree.
Apart from definition, interview can ask you to implement binary search tree in Java and questions on tree traversal e.g. IN order, preorder, and post order traversals are quite popular data structure question.

Question 15 : Write a Java program to implement Stack in Java?
You can implement Stack by using array or linked list.
This question expect you to implement standard method provided by stack data structure e.g.push() and pop().  Both push() and pop() should be happen at top of stack, which you need to keep track.
It’s also good if you can implement utility methods likecontains(), isEmpty() etc.

You can also check Effective Java book , where Josh Bloch has explains how an incorrect implementation of stack can cause memory leak in Java.

I have found answers via Google search, but it would be great to know your comments on these questions.
1. Write your own HashMap/Hashtable implementation in Java 2.
How to implement your own LinkedList (without using any Java API)

You can implement HashMap by using Array, because only provide constant time access, if you know index.
Key is to writing hash function to minimize collision.
Similarly, you can implement linked list by creating some class e.g. Node, which holds data and keep track of next node.
By the way, I will try to blog answers in more details.

                    <text>1) To determine if linked list has a loop or not..
You can detect it by simply running two pointers through the list.
Start the first pointer A on the first node and the second pointer B on the second node.

                    <text>Advance the first pointer by one every time through the loop, advance the second pointer by two.
If there is a loop, they will eventually point to the same node.
If there's no loop, you'll eventually hit the end with the advance-by-two pointer.

I will try to cover question of detecting linked list with loop, may be another post.
Once again, thanks for adding value.

For Question 3 another solution could be (with java.util.LinkedList), public static void get3rdElementFromEnd () { java.util.LinkedList ll = new java.util.LinkedList(); ll.add(&quot;A&quot;); ll.add(&quot;B&quot;); ll.add(&quot;C&quot;); ll.add(&quot;D&quot;); ll.add(&quot;E&quot;); ll.add(&quot;F&quot;); ll.add(&quot;G&quot;); int threeAhead=0, threeBack=0; System.out.println(&quot;ll.size = &quot;+ll.size()); if(ll.size() &gt; 3) { for(String s : ll) { threeAhead++; if(threeAhead &gt; 3 ) threeBack++; } int i = threeAhead - threeBack; System.out.println(&quot;-- i = &quot;+i); if( i == 3 ) { System.out.println(&quot;Third Element From End = &quot;+ll.get(threeBack)); } } } Please comment if this solution is not perfect at any point.

Hi guys, recently in an interview I was asked how would you reverse a linked list?
I answered that I would have a new list, iterate the original linked list and add elements of this list at head of new list.
Interviewer was not convinced with my answer.
Anyway I thought of writing a program to prove this...here is complete program.

Computer science emphasizes two important topics: datastructures and algorithms.

                <section>
                    <text>Those topics are important because the choices you make for a program's datastructures and algorithms affect that program's memory usage (for datastructures) and CPU time (for algorithms that interact with those datastructures).
When choosing a datastructure or algorithm, you sometimes discover an inverse relationship between memory usage and CPU time: the less memory a datastructure uses, the more CPU time associated algorithms need to process the datastructure'sdata items, which are primitive type values or objects, via references.

                    <text>Also, the more memory a datastructure uses, the less CPU time associated algorithms need to process the data items—and faster algorithms result.
This inverse relationship appears in Figure 1.

The inverse relationship between memory usage and CPU time An example of the inverse relationship between memory usage and CPU time involves the one-dimensional array and doubly-linked list datastructures, and their insertion/deletion algorithms.

                    <text>For any given list of data items, a one-dimensional array occupies less memory than a doubly linked list: a doubly linked list needs to associate links with data items to find each data item's predecessor and successor, which requires extra memory.
In contrast, a one-dimensional array's insertion/deletion algorithms are slower than a doubly linked list's equivalent algorithms: inserting a data item into or deleting a data item from a one-dimensional array requires data item movement to expose an empty element for insertion or close an element made empty by deletion.
(I explore one-dimensional arrays later in this article, and doubly linked lists in next month's article.)

The article begins with a presentation of basic concepts and continues with a tour of the array datastructure.
You learn about one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and ragged arrays, plus linear-search, bubble-sort, binary-search, and matrix-multiplication array-oriented algorithms.
The article ends by asserting that Java's arrays are objects.

What is an algorithm?
How do you represent an algorithm?

                    <text>Datastructures have been around since the structured programming era.
A definition from that era: a datastructure is a set of types, a designated type from that type set, a set of functions, and a set of axioms.
That definition implies that a datastructure is a type with implementation.
In our object-oriented programming era,type with implementation means class.

                    <text>The datastructure is a class definition is too broad because it embraces Employee, Vehicle, Account, and many other real-world entity-specific classes as datastructures.
Although those classes structure various data items, they do so to describe real-world entities (in the form of objects) instead of describing container objects for other entity (and possibly container) objects.

                    <text>This containment idea leads to a more appropriate datastructure definition: a datastructure is a container class that provides storage for data items, and capabilities for storing and retrieving data items.
Examples of container datastructures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
(I will explore the linked-list, stack, and queue datastructures next month.)

                    <text>I have followed a pattern ofimproving the problem solutions with different complexities (for each problem, you observe multiple solutionswith different improved complexities).
Basically, it’s an enumeration of possible solutions.
With this approach,even if we get a new question it gives us a way to think about all possible solutions.

We start with solution and slowly move towards the possible for that problem.
For each problemwe will try to understand how much time the algorithm is taking and how much memory the algorithm istaking.It is that, at least one complete reading of this book is required to get full understanding of allthe topics.

                    <text>Have a nice reading. - M-Tech, Founder of * ForewordWith the availability of different books on Data Structures and/or Algorithms, their design and analysis with ageneral or language based orientation; one would be in gross error to think that this book is one more to the list.Keeping in view the GATE and other competitive exams perspective in mind and critical time managementrequirement, the author has taken the approach of embedding theoretical concepts through efficient problemsolving.The different topics related to data structures and algorithms and their intricate interdependency have beendealt with comprehensive eloquence and subtle clarity.The topics coverage in the book spans from primitive to advanced data structures, their characteristics, theirspace and time complexity analysis, the different algorithmic paradigms/classifications, application areas andproblems and their analysis.Each topic is explained through a problem solving approach so that at the end, the reader is well equipped to beable to apply to any type of problem solving requirement and distinctly choose one strategy or type from theother.The book also includes solved GATE questions of last twenty years which works as a mock exam practice planefor the reader.
It is a very handy and must have book for any reader aiming for competitive exams of alluniversities and boards and as well as for campus recruitment.
It can also serve as a reference text-book forsoftware developers, who wanted to design and implement efficient algorithms. . , . * Table of Contents1.

All of us have solvedmany mathematical equations since childhood.
As an example, consider the below equation:We don’t have to worry about the use of above equation.

That means, the ( and ) are the place holdersfor representing data.
Similarly, in computer science we need something for holding data and are thefacility for doing that.1.2 Data typesIn the above equation, the variables and can take any values like integral numbers ( , etc...), real numbers( etc…) or just and .

                    <text>To solve the equation, we need to relate them to kind of values they can take and is the name being used in computer science for this purpose.A in a programming language is a set of data with values having predefined characteristics.
Examples ofdata types are: integer, floating point unit number, character, string etc...Computer memory is all filled with zeros and ones.
If we have a problem and wanted to code it, it’s very difficult toprovide the solution in terms of zeros and ones.

                    <text>A data type reduces the coding effort.
Basically, at the top level, there are two types of data types:  System defined data types (also called data types)  User defined data typesSystem defined data types (Primitive data types)Data types which are defined by system are called data types.
The primitive data types which are providedby many programming languages are: int, float, char, double, bool, etc… The number of bits allocated for eachprimitive data type depends on the programming languages, compiler and operating system.

This gives more flexibility and comfort in dealing with computer memory. struct newType { int data1; float data 2; … char data; };1.3 Data StructureBased on the above discussion, once we have data in variables, we need some mechanism for manipulating that data tosolve problems. is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be usedefficiently.

Depending on the organizationof the elements, data structures are classified into two types: 1) Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially (say, Linked Lists). : Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues.
2) : Elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a non-linear order. : Trees and graphs.1.4 Abstract Data Types (ADTs)Before defining abstract data types, let us consider the different view of system defined data types.

For user defined data types also we need to defineoperations.
The implementation for these operations can be done when we want to actually use them.

They come in to picture only when we want touse them.
Different kinds of ADTs are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized tospecific tasks.

The compiler also keeps an internal tag that associates the variable name with the addressof the first byte allocated to it (sometimes called as ).
So when we want to access that variable like this: , the compiler knows where that variable is located and it writes the value .

Then we print (which is ), followed by , i.e., the contents ofthe variable which is an address; the address of .
And finally we print , which is the value of the memorylocation where points to (again 10, since it points to the location occupied by the variable in memory).Finally we change the contents of the location where points to by writing , this means assign the value to wherever is pointing to.

This isbecause of the fact that each variable type takes different amount of memory.
On a -bit computer for exampleusually an int needs bytes, while a short bytes.

                    <text>So in order to read the actual value stored there, the compiler has toknow how many consecutive memory locations to read in order to get the full value.Pointer Manipulation: Another very useful thing we can do with pointers is to perform arithmetic operations on them.This might be obvious to the careful reader, since we said that pointers are just integers.
However, there are a fewsmall differences on pointer arithmetic that make their use even more intuitive and easy.
Try the following code: char *cptr = (char*)2; printf(&quot;cptr before: %p &quot;, cptr); cptr++; printf(&quot;and after: %pn&quot;, cptr);We declare a pointer named and assign the address to it.

                    <text>We print the contents of the pointer (i.e. the address ), increment it, and print again.
Sure enough the first time it prints and then , and that was exactly what weexpected.
However try this one as well: int *iptr = (int*)2; printf(&quot;iptr before: %p &quot;, iptr); iptr++; printf(&quot;and after: %pn&quot;, iptr);Now the output, on my computer, is before: and after: Why does this pointer point to the address 6 afterincremented it by one and not to as the previous pointer?

                    <text>This means that if we have an int at the address , then that int occupiesthe memory locations and .
So in order to access to the next int we have to look at the address and .Thus when we add one to a pointer, it is not the same as adding one to any integer, it means give me a pointer to thenext variable which for variables of type int, in this case, is bytes ahead.The reason that in the first example with the char pointer, the actual address after incrementing, was one more thanthe previous address is because the size of char is exactly .
So the next char can indeed be found on the next address.Another limitation of void pointers is that we cannot perform arithmetic on them, since the compiler cannot knowhow many bytes ahead is the next variable located.

                    <text>So void pointers can only be used to keep addresses that we have toconvert later on to a specific pointer type, before using them.Arrays and Pointers: There is a strong connection between arrays and pointers.
So strong in fact, that most of the timewe can treat them as the same thing.
The name of an array can be considered just as a pointer to the beginning of amemory block as big as the array.

                    <text>So for example, making a pointer point to the beginning of an array is done inexactly the same way as assigning the contents of a pointer to another: short *ptr; short array[10]; ptr = array;and then we can access the contents of the array through the pointer as if the pointer itself was that array.
Forexample this: is perfectly legal.
Furthermore, we can treat the array itself as a pointer, for example, is equivalent to In general is equivalent to .The only difference between an array, and a pointer to the beginning of an array, is that the compiler keeps some extrainformation for the arrays, to keep track of their storage requirements.

                    <text>For example if we get the size of both an arrayand a pointer using the operator, sizeof(ptr) will give us how much space does the pointer itself occupies ( onmy computer), while sizeof array will give us, the amount of space occupied by the whole array (on my computer elements of bytes each).1.6 Pointers 13 * Data Structures and Algorithms For GATE Programming BasicsDynamic Memory Allocation: In the earlier sections, we have seen that pointers can hold addressed of anothervariables.
There is another use of pointers: pointers can hold addresses of memory locations that do not have a specificcompile-time variable name, but are allocated dynamically while the program runs (sometimes such memory is called ).To allocate memory during runtime, language provides us the facility interns of function.
This functionallocates the requested amount of memory, and returns a pointer to that memory.

                    <text>To deallocate that block of memory, supports it by providing function.
This function takes the pointer as an argument.
For example, in the belowcode, an array of 5 integers is allocated dynamically, and then deleted. int count = 5; int *A = malloc(count * sizeof(int)); ……… free(arr);In this example, the calculates the amount of bytes we need to allocate for the array, bymultiplying the number of elements, to the size of each element (i.e. the size of one integer).Function Pointers: Like data, executable code (including functions) also stored in memory.

But the question is what type of pointers we use for that purpose?In general, we use function pointers and they store the address of functions.
Using function pointers we can call thefunction indirectly.

                    <text>But, function pointers manipulation has limitation: limited to assignment and indirection andcannot do arithmetic on function pointers.
Because for function pointers there no ordering (functions can be storedanywhere in memory).
The following example illustrates how to create and use function pointers. int (*fptr)(int); fptr = function1; printf(&quot;function1of 0 is: %dn&quot;, fptr(5)); fptr = function2; printf(&quot;function2 of 0 is: %dn&quot;, fptr(10));First we create a pointer that can point to functions accepting an as an argument and returning int, named .Then we make point to the , and proceed to call it through the pointer, to print the of .

                    <text>Answer (d) In mathematics, the transitive closure of a binary relation R on a set X is the smallest transitive relation on X that contains R.
If the original relation is transitive, the transitive closure will be that same relation; otherwise, the transitive closure will be a different relation.

                    <text>In computer science the concept of transitive closure can be thought of as constructing a data structure that makes it possible to answer reachability questions.
That is, can one get from node a to node other node b in one or more hops?
A binary relation tells you only that node a is connected to node b, and that node b is connected to node c, etc.
After the transitive closure is constructed in an O(1) operation one may determine that node c is reachable from node a.

                    <text>Warshall’s algorithm can be used to construct the Transitive closure of directed graphs ().
In Warshall’s original formulation of the algorithm, the graph is unweighted and represented by a Boolean adjacency matrix.
Then the addition operation is replaced by logical conjunction (AND) and the minimum operation by logical disjunction (OR).

For software fundamental interviews, I’m talking about interviews where questions are more vendor neutral (so databases in general rather than SQL Server).

                    <text>If you are going to a technology focused interview, it is quite possible you won’t be asked any questions on algorithms or data structures (which in my opinion is a bad sign of what your co-worker’s abilities might be).
Assuming you will be asked these questions, here are some thoughts about companies that preform each of these types of interviews.

                    <text>  Software Fundamentals Interviews Technology Focused Interviews Google, Amazon, Altera, Yahoo, Apple, Microsoft Typically consulting companies or companies that need to gain expertise in a new area Are more concerned with how intelligent/trainable someone is rather than how many technologies they know.
They are interested in developing employees in relevant areas if the potential is good.
Expect high productivity early on from new employees Senior developers and leads are very knowledgeable May not have experienced leads – hiring may be based on technology buzz words and HR processes rather than software engineering concepts People that work for these companies generally hold co-workers in high regard Co-workers may have less respect for each other These companies generally offer hire salaries and are more competitive about getting good employees (in my experience) May offer a very high salary if technology is niche.

Not necessarily looking to fill a technology niche that you can be a leader in Often offers more leadership opportunities, especially if niche technology (since there may not be strong senior developers) Job postings mention fundamental concepts like OOP or design patterns and not specific technologies.

                    <text>For senior positions, questions will start with fundamentals but seniority will be based on answers to open ended design questions (and resume experience) For senior positions, determining seniority the interviewer will probably expect you to know a specific detail about the technology.
The problem with this is that at the senior level, there are many specific questions about the technology and with this type of questioning, the interviewer is trying to find holes (based on his own understanding) rather than your strengths.
Since interview time is limited, occasionally an interviewer will throw in a tough algorithm problem (often involving a trick) and base evaluate your understanding of algorithms based on that.   Note that the points above are just my general observations and do not always hold true.

                    <text>I’ve had technology specific interviews for consulting companies that definitely contain all the desirable attributes from the software fundamentals section above.
Currently, my preference is for software fundamentals interviews since I find technology focused interviews tend to be all over the place.

In this situation, it is very easy to have a false negatives and false positives since questions are not comprehensive.

                    <text>My key criteria for recommending these books is that they are easy to read cover to cover compared to other algorithms books.
The best technique for interviewing is to make a list of all the key algorithms (Algorithms (Sedgewick, Wayne)) and then beside each one, describe how to solve it in just a few sentences.
It doesn’t need to be in detail; just enough so that you know how to start solving the problem.

                    <text>  Algorithms (Sedgewick, Wayne) -I like head first type books that I can read quickly and remember easily without falling asleep.
I think this is as close as an algorithms book gets being similar to the heads first series in that the explanations are easy to understand and not too dry.
Here are my favourite things about this book.

                    <text>* Relatively clear description on big o notation and calculating complexity * Light read, not scary compared to other algorithm text books, not too much math * Offers simple readable code for all data structures * Does a fantastic job of providing clear descriptions of optimizations for each algorithm.
This really allows you to shine in interviews because you can show off with something that might be new even to the interviewer * Algorithms organized by problem rather than method (for example, there are chapters on graphs, string matching, searching, sorting, etc but no chapters on greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, etc).
Some people may not like this so if you are looking for something that is also pretty easy to read but organized by problem solving approach, I suggest Algorithms (Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazerani) - I did not read this book cover to cover like the one above.

Practice under similar conditions Join TopCoder and do some practice problems and do at least 5 single round marathon (SRM) competitions – You don’t need a super high rank (even division 2 is fine) but you need to be able to effective approach problems.
The things you can expect to be comfortable with after doing about 5 SRMs and reading the editorials after the matches are:

                    <text>* Analizing complexity – you will be surprised how often a brute force solution is enough based on inputs.
This will cause you to ask input constrain questions during the interview which shows that not only can you solve problems in multiple ways, but that you know when to use each approach. * How to categorize types of problems – Is it greedy, or dynamic programming * You will be decent at dynamic programming – Interviewers love DP questions because they can be very tricky (I don’t mean just using memoization for fibinocci).
You will need to correctly identify which states need to be remembered and in cases where there are many candidate states, this is very tricky * In the end, you will approach your interview algorithm problems with confidence.

                    <text>SRMs force you to wait a couple days for the answer after the match which really helps learn the methodology Thoughts on Questions with a Trick A trick question is one where you need to have a moment of inspiration to solve the algorithm.
For example, given a sorted array of numbers, determine if there are two that add to 30.

Have a pointer on each end of the list.
Add the two numbers together.
If the result is greater than 30, move the pointer on the right on position left.

                    <text>If the result is less than 30, move the pointer on the left one to the right.
This O(n) solution does not determine if the candidate knows anything about alogrithms.
It just shows that either the candidate got a moment of clarity at the right time, or has seen the problem before.
In my experience with interviews at tech giants Amazon and Google, I did not receive any trick questions.

                    <text>Trick questions give a lot of false negatives and as far as I’ve seen, mature companies have decided to stop using them.
If you do get asked a trick question and don’t get the answer, don’t feel bad.
Perhaps the company asking it needs to update their hiring policy :)

                    <text>The Kindle version looks like it was slapped together quickly to seize the market.
Chalked full of grammatical errors and the like, I honestly can't recommend this book in the slightest.
I'll be paging through &quot;Algorithms in a Nutshell&quot; from O'Reilly instead, along with some of my old computer science texts to ensure that my skills are sharp for technical interviews.

Unfortunately, my teacher is not very good, and the online book we use is incredibly vague in its descriptions (http://people.cs.vt.edu/~shaffer/Book/) I've manage to maintain an A thus far, mostly due to luck and common sense, but it's starting to get a lot harder now that we are dealing with sorts, searches, and more advanced data structures like graphs.

I understand the major importance of knowing this topic well, especially when writing efficient code and also when being interviewed for a job, so I'm open to any suggestions that will help me learn and understand algorithms and data structures better.
Thanks.

If you look for your instructor's strengths and get what you can from the book, you'll go far.
I glanced through your text and it didn't seem all that vague to me.
Definitely look at the references provided in other answers, but be positive about the class too.

I remember my first data structure and algorithms class (which is a somewhat hard to grasp subject at first).
My teacher had a very strong Russian accent and gave us assignments he used to give to students 4-5 years more advanced in their CS studies as we were.
It was painful.

I'm normally not one to put any blame for how I do in the class on the teacher, but it's just that this topic seems to require a good amount of in depth explaining, which my professor doesn't seem to do.

Whether it's an algorithm, and new design pattern or a data structure, the process of creating that thing in code has always been the way I've learned best.

                    <text>Not that mine were any better than the STL's (I still suggest you use that if the right containers are available), but just saying, you'll understand how they work.
The book puts heavy emphasis on data-structures compared to algorithms though, so you may have to find other supplemental material for that end of things. – Jason Mar 31 '11 at 20:02 I'll be sure to give that a read.

                    <text>Thanks. – SkankinJake Mar 31 '11 at 20:12 You won't build them perfectly =) - that's fine.
The experience of trying to turn an abstract concept into a concrete implementation will help you to grasp the concepts.
Even as a professional developer with a few years experience I still create small test applications to learn new concepts. – Nathanael Mar 31 '11 at 21:33 up vote 0 down vote I particularly liked this book: Data Structures with C++ Using STL by Ford and Topp.

                    <text>They include quite a bit of source-code (all of it can be downloaded from their website) and nicely step the reader through a thorough nuts-and-bolts implementation of many of the data-structures implemented in the STL, as well as a couple data-structures (like graphs) that aren't present in the STL.
You'll get a good understanding of each data-structure's internal composition from more basic data-types, as well as a generic enough reference that should you ever need to build something yourself, you'll have a very good idea of exactly how these data-structures can be created and composed from simpler data-types (in a generic sense ... i.e., these ideas can be transposed to any other language) and how they should be applied in real-world settings.

                    <text>It's not so much a reference for the STL itself, as it is a reference on how the data-structures in the STL were implemented (albeit in a more simplistic form ... you won't have to worry about allocators, and many of the other ancillaries in the STL code that can make it a bit hard to read and understand for a beginner).

(i) If m=n then m=n=gcd(m,n) and the algorithm sets m to zero and returns n, obviously correct.
(ii) Otherwise, suppose m&gt;n.
Then m=p×g and n=q×g where p and q are coprime, from the definition of greatest common divisor.
We claim that gcd(m-n,n)=g.

Ifnot then p-q=a×c and q=b×c for some a,b,c&gt;1.
But then p=q+a×c=b×c+a×c=(a+b)×c and because q=b×c, p and q would not have been coprime ... contradiction.
Hence (p-q) and q are coprime, and gcd(m-n,n)=gcd(m,n).

                    <text>Complexity We are interested in how much time and space (computer memory) a computer algorithm uses;i.e. how efficient it is.
This is called time- and space- complexity.
Typically the complexity is a function of the values of the inputs and we would like to know what function.
We can also consider thebest-, average-, and worst-cases.

                    <text>Time The time to execute one iteration of the loop depends on whether m&gt;n or not, but both cases take constant time: one test, a subtraction and 4 assignments v. one test, a subtraction and one assignment.
So the time taken for one iteration of the loop is bounded by a constant.
The real question then is, how many iterations take place?
The answer depends on m and n.

                    <text>Similarly while going on questions from data structure you may get some programming exercise as well e.g. swapping numbers without temp variable .Linked list and arrays are favorite topics in any data structure interview, questions like reversing linked list, traversing linked list or deleting nodes from linked list, which involves algorithm and data structures are quite common.
Similarly, finding duplicates in array, finding missing numbers, sorting arrays are very popular.

                    <text>Data Structures and Algorithm Interview Questions for Java Programmers This is combined list of questions from various data structure e.g. array, linked list, stack or queue.
It includes some coding questions as well, which gel with data structures.  Question 1 : How to find middle element of linked list in one pass?

                <section>
                    <text>One of the most popular question from data structures and algorithm, mostly asked on telephonic interview.
Since many programmer know that, in order to find length of linked list we need to first traverse through linkedlist till we find last node, which is pointing to null, and then in second pass we can find middle element by traversing only half of length.

                <section>
                    <text>They get confused when interviewer ask him to do same job in one pass.
In order to find middle element of linked list in one pass you need to maintain two pointer, one increment at each node while other increments after two nodes at a time, by having this arrangement, when first pointer reaches end, second pointer will point to middle element of linked list.

                <section>
                    <text>See this trick to find middle element of linked list in single pass for more details.
Question 2 : How to find if linked list has loop ?
This question has bit of similarity with earlier algorithm and data structure interview question.

                    <manualLabel>1</manualLabel>
                    <svmLabel>0</svmLabel>

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>I mean we can use two pointer approach to solve this problem.
If we maintain two pointers, and we increment one pointer after processing two nodes and other after processing every node, we are likely to find a situation where both the pointers will be pointing to same node.
This will only happen if linked list has loop.
Question 3 : How to find 3rd element from end in a linked list in one pass?
This is another frequently asked linked list interview question.

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>This question is exactly similarto finding middle element of linked list in single pass .If we apply same trick of maintaining two pointers and increment other pointer, when first has moved upto 3rd element, than when first pointer reaches to the end of linked list, second pointer will be pointing to the 3rd element from last in a linked list.
Question 4 : In an integer array, there is 1 to 100 number, out of one is duplicate, how to find ?

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>This is a rather simple data structures question, especially for this kind of.
In this case you can simply add all numbers stored in array, and total sum should be equal ton(n+1)/2.
Now just subtract actual sum to expected sum, and that is your duplicate number.

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>Of course there is a brute force way of checking each number against all other numbers, but that will result in performance of O(n&lt;s&gt;2) which is not good.
By the way this trick will not work if array have multiple duplicates or its not numbers forming arithmetic progression.
Here is example of one wayto find duplicate number in array .
Question 6 : How to reverse String in Java ?

                <section>
                    <text>This is one of my favorite question.
SinceString is one of the most important type in programming, you expect lot of question related to String any data structure interview.

                <section>
                    <text>There are many ways to reverse Sting in Java or any other programming language, and interviewer will force you to solve this problem by using without API i.e. without usingreverse() method of StringBuffer.
In follow-up he may ask to reverse String using recursion as well.

                    <text>Question 7 : Write a Java program to sort a array using Bubble Sort algorithm?
I have always send couple of questions from searching and sorting in data structure interviews.

                <section>
                    <text>Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithm but if you ask anyone to implement on the spot it gives you an opportunity to gauge programming skills of a candidate.
See How to sort array using Bubble Sort in Java forcomplete solution of this datastrucutre interview question.
Question 8 : What is difference between Stack and Queue data structure ?

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>One of the classical datastrucutre interview question.
I guess every one know, No?
Any way main difference is that Stack is LIFO(Last In First Out) data structure while Queue is a FIFO(First In First Out) data structure.
Question 9 : How do you find duplicates in array if there is more than one duplicate?
Sometime this is asked as follow-up question of earlier datastrucutre interview question, related to finding duplicates in Array.

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>One way of solving this problem is usinga Hashtable or HashMap datastructure.
You can traverse through array, and store each number as key and number of occurrence as value.
At the end of traversal you can find all duplicate numbers, for which occurrence is more than one.
In Java if a number already exists in HashMap then calling get(index) will return number otherwise it return null. this property can be used to insert or update numbers inHashMap.

                <section>
                    <text>Main difference between singly linked list and doubly linked list is ability to traverse.
In a single linked list, node only points towards next node, and there is no pointer to previous node, which means you can not traverse back on a singly linked list.
On the other hand doubly linked list maintains two pointers, towards next and previous node, which allows you to navigate in both direction in any linked list.

                    <text>Fibonacci series is a mathematical series, where each number is sum of previous two numbers e.g. 1,1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21.
Interviewer is often interested in two things, a function which returns nth number in Fibonacci series and solving this problem using recursion in Java.

Question 12 : Write Java program to check if a number is palindrome or not?
This is similar to previous question, not directly related to data structures, but quite popular along with other questions.
A number is called palindrome, if reverse of number is equal to number itself.
Interviewer ask to solve this problem without taking help from Java API or any open source library.

                    <text>Any way it’s simple question, you can use division operator (/) and remainder operator (%) to solve this question.
Just remember, division operator can be used to get rid of last digit e.g. 1234/10 will give you 123, and modulus operator can give you last digit e.g. 1234%10 will return 4.
By the way, here isa Java program check if number is palindrome or not .
Question 13 : What is binary search tree?
This is a data structure question from Tree data structures.

                    <text>Binary Search Tree has some special properties e.g. left nodes contains items whose value is less than root , right sub tree contains keys with higher node value than root, and there should not be any duplicates in the tree.
Apart from definition, interview can ask you to implement binary search tree in Java and questions on tree traversal e.g. IN order, preorder, and post order traversals are quite popular data structure question.

Question 15 : Write a Java program to implement Stack in Java?
You can implement Stack by using array or linked list.
This question expect you to implement standard method provided by stack data structure e.g.push() and pop().  Both push() and pop() should be happen at top of stack, which you need to keep track.
It’s also good if you can implement utility methods likecontains(), isEmpty() etc.

You can implement HashMap by using Array, because only provide constant time access, if you know index.
Key is to writing hash function to minimize collision.
Similarly, you can implement linked list by creating some class e.g. Node, which holds data and keep track of next node.
By the way, I will try to blog answers in more details.

                    <text>1) To determine if linked list has a loop or not..
You can detect it by simply running two pointers through the list.
Start the first pointer A on the first node and the second pointer B on the second node.

If there is a loop, they will eventually point to the same node.
If there's no loop, you'll eventually hit the end with the advance-by-two pointer.

(Check the boundary conditions ... and account for the list length being less than N_FROM_END.)

I will try to cover question of detecting linked list with loop, may be another post.
Once again, thanks for adding value.

For Question 3 another solution could be (with java.util.LinkedList), public static void get3rdElementFromEnd () { java.util.LinkedList ll = new java.util.LinkedList(); ll.add(&quot;A&quot;); ll.add(&quot;B&quot;); ll.add(&quot;C&quot;); ll.add(&quot;D&quot;); ll.add(&quot;E&quot;); ll.add(&quot;F&quot;); ll.add(&quot;G&quot;); int threeAhead=0, threeBack=0; System.out.println(&quot;ll.size = &quot;+ll.size()); if(ll.size() &gt; 3) { for(String s : ll) { threeAhead++; if(threeAhead &gt; 3 ) threeBack++; } int i = threeAhead - threeBack; System.out.println(&quot;-- i = &quot;+i); if( i == 3 ) { System.out.println(&quot;Third Element From End = &quot;+ll.get(threeBack)); } } } Please comment if this solution is not perfect at any point.

Hi guys, recently in an interview I was asked how would you reverse a linked list?
I answered that I would have a new list, iterate the original linked list and add elements of this list at head of new list.
Interviewer was not convinced with my answer.
Anyway I thought of writing a program to prove this...here is complete program.

The author makes some misleading statements (especially regarding ArrayList resize behavior) and omits some key points (some of which were admittedly filled in by Stephen Colebourne in the blog comments). – David Citron Jan 22 '12 at 21:12 @DavidCitron can you point to some blog/article that includes the discussion of all the bulletted points in your answer below. – Geek Jul 19 '12 at 13:13 up vote 10 down vote Once when I was interviewing for Microsoft in college, the guy asked me how to detect a cycle in a linked list.

I assume they cared more about how you would come up with the answer, rather than the answer itself, optimal or not. – Terry Li Oct 7 '11 at 18:33 4   I would say, hash the address of the nodes,and put them in map. if you encounter a node that has already been mapped. bingo!.

Where current moves from (next to start to end) and start moves between start and current.

If next encounters null, there is no cycle if ever next is equal to start, then we have a cycle –  fayyazkl May 28 '12 at 6:05 Here's an option for an out of the box solution - lets say that you know you can iterate over the list at some rate (# nodes/sec) and know how much memory is allocated to this list and sizeof the nodes, then you should get to the end of the list within a time proprotional to the ratio of those two, so stopwatch it.

Both of these are easy enough to be doable in a short time, and difficult enough to eliminate the clueless.

I'm sure that ideal for your work, but where I work if you answered that question with a regex solution that would be considered very bad.

Agreed regex's are not for most things.
For such a contrived example, would you really place runtime constraints like that?
In general .net where my expertise lies, you aren't scrutinizing your code to the clock cycle.

A lot of it tends to come down to whether or not the candidate knows the shortest path and graph traversal algorithms, is familiar with cycle types and detection, and whether they know the complexity bounds.
I think a lot of questions about this stuff comes down to trivia more than on the spot creative thinking ability.

                    <text>I like the Project Euler problem that asks to find the most expensive path down a tree (16/67); common ancestor is a good warm up, but a lot of people have seen it.
Asking somebody to design a tree class, perform traversals, and then figure out from which traversals they could rebuild a tree also gives some insight into data structure and algorithm implementation.
The Stern-Brocot programming challenge is also interesting and quick to develop on a board ( http://online-judge.uva.es/p/v100/10077.html ).

2.On default screen it shows the names of all people in alphabetical ascending order.
3.Using the search option, user can search and it will show only those names starting with those characters which are typed in the search box.
You are supposed to compare two different data structures and list down the pros and cons of each and finally recommend the best suited data structure.

It is now required to display the 'Top 50' pins to the users on the website.
Each pin has an associated 'score id' which is constantly updated as users 'like' the pin.

Now read the file and we need to determine the order of execution of function depending on the input parameter list we can't execute f1 first because we have only parameters a , b and d f2 can be executed because we have a, b and d parameters, which gives parameter c now f3 can be executed because we have parameters a and c.. so we need to find the order and execute functions as quickly as possible (can use multi threading) so efficient order is f2 and f4 can run parallel and then f1 and f3 can be started only after completion of f2.
What are the data structures we use here to solve this problem Consider execute function which takes always 1st parameter as filename and the rest of parameters as dynamic (similar to ... in java for dynamic parameter list)

etc and provides answer to each question.
It provides no real value for your interview, I think wiki is much better source for those concepts than this book. not recommend to buy this book for your interview Comment |  Was this review helpful to you?

I was sorely disappointed.

                    <text>The Kindle version looks like it was slapped together quickly to seize the market.
Chalked full of grammatical errors and the like, I honestly can't recommend this book in the slightest.
I'll be paging through &quot;Algorithms in a Nutshell&quot; from O'Reilly instead, along with some of my old computer science texts to ensure that my skills are sharp for technical interviews.

                    <text>Recursive algorithm is a method of simplification that divides the problem into sub-problems of the same nature.
The result of one recursion is the input for the next recursion.
The repletion is in the self-similar fashion.
The algorithm calls itself with smaller input values and obtains the results by simply performing the operations on these smaller values.
Generation of factorial, Fibonacci number series are the examples of recursive algorithms.

Fibonacci search examines locations whose addresses have lower dispersion.
When the search element has non-uniform access memory storage, the Fibonacci search algorithm reduces the average time needed for accessing a storage location.

                    <text>By technology focused interviews, I’m talking about interviews where a question will be based on a vendor’s product such as SQL Server.  
For software fundamental interviews, I’m talking about interviews where questions are more vendor neutral (so databases in general rather than SQL Server).

                    <text>If you are going to a technology focused interview, it is quite possible you won’t be asked any questions on algorithms or data structures (which in my opinion is a bad sign of what your co-worker’s abilities might be).
Assuming you will be asked these questions, here are some thoughts about companies that preform each of these types of interviews.

                    <text>  Software Fundamentals Interviews Technology Focused Interviews Google, Amazon, Altera, Yahoo, Apple, Microsoft Typically consulting companies or companies that need to gain expertise in a new area Are more concerned with how intelligent/trainable someone is rather than how many technologies they know.
They are interested in developing employees in relevant areas if the potential is good.
Expect high productivity early on from new employees Senior developers and leads are very knowledgeable May not have experienced leads – hiring may be based on technology buzz words and HR processes rather than software engineering concepts People that work for these companies generally hold co-workers in high regard Co-workers may have less respect for each other These companies generally offer hire salaries and are more competitive about getting good employees (in my experience) May offer a very high salary if technology is niche.

Not necessarily looking to fill a technology niche that you can be a leader in Often offers more leadership opportunities, especially if niche technology (since there may not be strong senior developers) Job postings mention fundamental concepts like OOP or design patterns and not specific technologies.

                    <text>For senior positions, questions will start with fundamentals but seniority will be based on answers to open ended design questions (and resume experience) For senior positions, determining seniority the interviewer will probably expect you to know a specific detail about the technology.
The problem with this is that at the senior level, there are many specific questions about the technology and with this type of questioning, the interviewer is trying to find holes (based on his own understanding) rather than your strengths.
Since interview time is limited, occasionally an interviewer will throw in a tough algorithm problem (often involving a trick) and base evaluate your understanding of algorithms based on that.   Note that the points above are just my general observations and do not always hold true.

                    <text>My key criteria for recommending these books is that they are easy to read cover to cover compared to other algorithms books.
The best technique for interviewing is to make a list of all the key algorithms (Algorithms (Sedgewick, Wayne)) and then beside each one, describe how to solve it in just a few sentences.
It doesn’t need to be in detail; just enough so that you know how to start solving the problem.

                    <text>  Algorithms (Sedgewick, Wayne) -I like head first type books that I can read quickly and remember easily without falling asleep.
I think this is as close as an algorithms book gets being similar to the heads first series in that the explanations are easy to understand and not too dry.
Here are my favourite things about this book.

                    <text>* Relatively clear description on big o notation and calculating complexity * Light read, not scary compared to other algorithm text books, not too much math * Offers simple readable code for all data structures * Does a fantastic job of providing clear descriptions of optimizations for each algorithm.
This really allows you to shine in interviews because you can show off with something that might be new even to the interviewer * Algorithms organized by problem rather than method (for example, there are chapters on graphs, string matching, searching, sorting, etc but no chapters on greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, etc).
Some people may not like this so if you are looking for something that is also pretty easy to read but organized by problem solving approach, I suggest Algorithms (Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazerani) - I did not read this book cover to cover like the one above.

                    <text>However, I do use it from time to time as a reference and it is a solid follow up to the Sedgewick, Wayne algorithms book.  It contains more details on algorithm approach than then one above, however, it is not quite as fun to read.   3.
Practice under similar conditions Join TopCoder and do some practice problems and do at least 5 single round marathon (SRM) competitions – You don’t need a super high rank (even division 2 is fine) but you need to be able to effective approach problems.
The things you can expect to be comfortable with after doing about 5 SRMs and reading the editorials after the matches are:

                    <text>* Analizing complexity – you will be surprised how often a brute force solution is enough based on inputs.
This will cause you to ask input constrain questions during the interview which shows that not only can you solve problems in multiple ways, but that you know when to use each approach. * How to categorize types of problems – Is it greedy, or dynamic programming * You will be decent at dynamic programming – Interviewers love DP questions because they can be very tricky (I don’t mean just using memoization for fibinocci).
You will need to correctly identify which states need to be remembered and in cases where there are many candidate states, this is very tricky * In the end, you will approach your interview algorithm problems with confidence.

                    <text>SRMs force you to wait a couple days for the answer after the match which really helps learn the methodology Thoughts on Questions with a Trick A trick question is one where you need to have a moment of inspiration to solve the algorithm.
For example, given a sorted array of numbers, determine if there are two that add to 30.

                    <text>If you have not seen the problem before, you might ho and hmm until it clicks.
Have a pointer on each end of the list.
Add the two numbers together.
If the result is greater than 30, move the pointer on the right on position left.

                    <text>If the result is less than 30, move the pointer on the left one to the right.
This O(n) solution does not determine if the candidate knows anything about alogrithms.
It just shows that either the candidate got a moment of clarity at the right time, or has seen the problem before.
In my experience with interviews at tech giants Amazon and Google, I did not receive any trick questions.

                    <text>Trick questions give a lot of false negatives and as far as I’ve seen, mature companies have decided to stop using them.
If you do get asked a trick question and don’t get the answer, don’t feel bad.
Perhaps the company asking it needs to update their hiring policy :)

Each constant is assigned a value in the following way: A = 1; the rest of the values equal their position in the alphabet (B corresponds to the second position so it equals 2, C = 3, etc.) raised to the power of the preceeding constant value.
So, B = 2 &lt;s&gt; (A's value), or B = 2&lt;s&gt;1 = 2.

Questions and Answers Useful tips * Introduction The technical interview is perhaps the most intimidating and mysterious event that job hunters experience in the quest for that &quot;killer offer.&quot;
The rigor and format of the technical interview varies from one company to the next, but there are some fundamental similarities.
An interviewer presents you with a problem to be solved.

                <section>
                    <text>The interviewer may leave the room and give you some time to work the solution out before returning.
Or the interviewer may wait patiently while you study the problem and figure it out.
The interviewer may even start quizzing you right away about aspects of the problem and approaches to solving it.
Some of these problems can appear quite challenging, especially if you've never been through a technical interview before.

On the other hand, getting the correct answer may not even be necessary.
What is an interviewer looking for in candidates during the technical interview?
Interviewers recognize that this setting is, by its very nature, stressful.

                    <text>You should never assume that you have been given all the data necessary to solve the problem to the satisfaction of the interviewer.
This is especially likely to be the case when interviewing with IT consulting companies.
In this environment, the client may need some prodding in order to provide a complete specification.

The ideal candidate will ask these questions rather than spend all the allotted time coming up with a solution that doesn't meet the client's needs.

Of interest are how possible solutions are considered and eliminated.
And frankly, watching a candidate sit and stare at a problem isn't all that entertaining for the interviewer.
Always allow sufficient time for design.

                    <text>Interviewers, hinting at possible improvements, may prod you at this point.
Occasionally, you may take an approach that the interviewer didn't anticipate.
At this point, an interviewer may ask you to take a more conventional approach.
This doesn't mean that you've done anything wrong; very often, an interviewer may be leading you along a particular approach with a purpose in mind.
The interviewer may be intending to ask follow-up questions or present new problems that build on a particular solution.

Just because you are being interviewed (and therefore, coding on a whiteboard or on a piece of paper) doesn't give you an excuse to be sloppy or lazy.
Commenting code for an interview may seem like a waste of time, but some interviewers do look to see that candidates write comments while coding or before coding, rather than adding them in as an afterthought.

If you begin you journey from any point (say Y1) on this special circle, and travel one mile south, you get to a point (say X1) on the circle of point X.
Now one mile east will bring you back to X1, because circumference of circle of X is 1 mile.
Then one mile North brings you back to Y1.

                    <text>The answer is that you need to store all possible configurations of the board and the move that is associated with that.
Then it boils down to just accessing the right element and getting the corresponding move for it.
Do some analysis and do some more optimization in storage since otherwise it becomes infeasible to get the required storage in a DOS machine.

Each constant is assigned a value in the following way: A = 1; the rest of the values equal their position in the alphabet (B corresponds to the second position so it equals 2, C = 3, etc.) raised to the power of the preceeding constant value.
So, B = 2 &lt;s&gt; (A's value), or B = 2&lt;s&gt;1 = 2.

Factorials of negative numbers are undefined, and the factorial of both 0 and 1 are 1.
The functions in Example 1 handle these cases correctly, and they initialize all variables.

There are, however, other ways to write this function recursively in C that are not as expensive.
For instance, you could maintain static variables or create a struct to hold previously computed results.

                    <text>Given a char pointer, strlen() determines the number of chars in a string.
The first thing that your strlen() implementation ought to do is to check your boundary conditions.
Don't forget the case where the pointer you are given is pointing to an empty string.
What about the case where the pointer is equal to NULL?

                    <text>This is a case where you should state your assumptions.
In many implementations, the real strlen() doesn't check to see if the pointer is NULL, so passing a NULL pointer to strlen() would result in a segmentation fault.
Making it clear to your interviewer that you are aware of both of these boundary conditions shows that you understand the problem and that you have thought about its solution carefully.
Example 3 shows the correct solution.

It tests whether 'a' is a power of 2.
Actually, it tests if a has only one instance of 1 bit, which is same as 'a' being power of 2.
For example, if a is 00010000 then result is 0, and if a is 01001000 then result is 01000000 which is not 0.

                    <text>If the values don't match, the string isn't a palindrome.
Otherwise, move each pointer inward and repeat the comparison.
Stop when the pointers are pointing to the same position in the string (if its length is an odd-number) or when the pointers have &quot;crossed&quot; (if the string's length is an even-number).
Example 5 shows the correct solution.

                    <text>Eight-bit numbers can be in the range from 0 to 255.
Two-bit numbers are in the range from 0 to 3.
Basically, we want to divide the 256 numbers specified by an eight-bit number into four ranges, which can be indicated by a two-bit number.
So, divide the range of 0 to 255 uniformly into four separate ranges: 0 to 63, 64 to 127, 128 to 191, and 192 to 255.

                    <text>In the case of call-by-reference, a pointer reference to a variable is passed into a function instead of the actual value.
The function's operations will effect the variable in a global as well as local sense.
Call-by-value (C's method of parameter passing), by contrast, passes a copy of the variable's value into the function.
Any changes to the variable made by function have only a local effect and do not alter the state of the variable passed into the function.

It combines one or more base or aggregate data types into a package that may treated as a whole.
A structure is like a record in other languages.

                    <text>They both provide access to members of a structure or union.
They differ in that -&gt; is used when the variable is a pointer to a structure or union.
The dot is used when the variable is itself the structure or union.
The -&gt; operator combines the pointer dereferencing operator with the member access operator; it is syntactic &quot;sugar coating.&quot;

Consider 1 + 5 and 1 + 5.1.
In the former, the message &quot;+ 5&quot; is sent to an object of class integer (1).
In the later, the message &quot;+ 5.1&quot; is sent to the same integer object.

                    <text>The form of the message (its protocol) is identical in both cases.
What differs is the type of object on the right-hand side of these messages.
The former is an integer object (5) while the later is a floating point object (5.1).
The receiver (1) appears (to other objects) to respond in the same way to both messages.
Internally, however, it knows that it must treat the two types of objects differently in order to obtain the same overall response.

Objects are meant to represent logically separate entities (like real world objects).
Objects are grouped together (and defined by) classes.
(This is analogous to user defined data types in procedural languages.)
Classes may pass-on their &quot;makeup&quot; to classes derived from them.

Then you should explain how the extern &quot;C&quot; linkage specification statement turns that feature off during compilation so that the linker properly links function calls to C functions.
Another acceptable answer is &quot;I don't know.
We never had to do that.&quot;
Merely describing what a linker does would indicate to me that you do not understand the issue that underlies the question.

Believe it or not, many programmers think that a C++ struct is just like a C struct, while a C++ class has inheritance, access specifiers, member functions, overloaded operators, and so on.
Some of them have even written books about C++.

The only differences are that a struct defaults to public member access and public base class inheritance, and a class defaults to the private access specifier and private base class inheritance.
Getting this question wrong does not necessarily disqualify you because you will be in plenty of good company.
Getting it right is a definite plus.

Many old-timer C programmers who made the switch to C++ never use the second idiom, although some wise heads of C++ profess to prefer it.

First, if it executes in a member function for an extern, static, or automatic object, the program will probably crash as soon as the delete statement executes.
There is no portable way for an object to tell that it was instantiated on the heap, so the class cannot assert that its object is properly instantiated.

Many programmers believe that delete this is a valid construct.
In my experience, classes that use delete this when objects are instantiated by users usually spawn bugs related to the idiom, most often when a program dereferences a pointer to an object that has already deleted itself.

                    <text>The compiler uses this idiom as one way to infer conversion rules for a class.
A constructor with more than one argument and with default argument values can be interpreted by the compiler as a conversion constructor when the compiler is looking for an object of the type and sees an object of the type of the constructor's first argument.

                    <text>First, you must know that a copy constructor is one that has only one argument, which is a reference to the same type as the constructor.
The compiler invokes a copy constructor wherever it needs to make a copy of the object, for example to pass an argument by value.
If you do not provide a copy constructor, the compiler creates a member-by-member copy constructor for you.

If you do not provide an overloaded assignment operator for the class, the compiler creates a default member-by-member assignment operator.

When you diagram these relationships, it becomes apparent that multiple inheritance is an intuitive way to model this common problem domain.
You should understand, however, that multiple inheritance, like a chainsaw, is a useful tool that has its perils, needs respect, and is best avoided except when nothing else will do.
Stress this understanding because your interviewer might share the common bias against multiple inheritance that many object-oriented designers hold.

But if you get ISA and HASA right, you usually don't need to go any further.

The most important advantage of encapsulation is that it lets the programmer create an object and then provide an interface to the object that other objects can use to call the methods provided by the object.
The programmer can change the internal workings of an object but this transparent to other interfacing programs as long as the interface remains unchanged.

For e.g. vehicle can be a super-class and car can be a sub-class derived from vehicle.

                    <text>In this case a car is a vehicle.
The super class 'is not a' sub-class as the sub- class is more specialized and may contain additional members as compared to the super class.
The greatest advantage of inheritance is that it promotes generic design and code reuse.

                    <text>Multiple Inheritance is the process whereby a sub-class can be derived from more than one super class.
The advantage of multiple inheritance is that it allows a class to inherit the functionality of more than one base class thus allowing for modeling of complex relationships.
The disadvantage of multiple inheritance is that it can lead to a lot of confusion when two base classes implement a method with the same name.

                    <text>Polymorphism refers to the ability to have more than one method with the same signature in an inheritance hierarchy.
The correct method is invoked at run-time based on the context (object) on which the method is invoked.
Polymorphism allows for a generic use of method names while providing specialized implementations for them.

                    <text>When a class member is declared to be of a static type, it means that the member is not an instance variable but a class variable.
Such a member is accessed using Classname.Membername (as opposed to Object.Membername).
Const is a keyword used in C++ to specify that an object's value cannot be changed.

The bug was that he declared an object locally in a function and tried to return the pointer to that object.
Since the object is local to the function, it no more exists after returning from the function.
The pointer, therefore, is invalid outside.

No wonder many programmers don't understand the power and implications of const.
Someone who claims to have enough interest in the language and its evolution to keep pace with the ANSI deliberations should not be ignorant of const, however.

                    <text>Multiple providers of libraries might use common global identifiers causing a name collision when an application tries to link with two or more such libraries.
The name-space feature surrounds a library's external declarations with a unique namespace that eliminates the potential for those collisions.

If your technical you better know your weaknesses.
Microsoft doesn't try to intimidate you, but they do ask detailed programming questions.
Be able to go to the whiteboard and code and/or answer logic scenarios.

If a weakness is spotted they typically pass that information on to the next person to see how weak you are in a certain area.

The goal is not to be a hardass.
And if you are weak in an area that doesn't mean you won't get the job - unless it directly applies to your job - but rather they want to make sure they know the candidate they are getting.

This will include how well you present your willingness to work with others and if they think you will do well/enjoy the work for the position.
Read up on and show an enthusiasm for the technical area you're interviewing for.

                    <text>In computer science the concept of transitive closure can be thought of as constructing a data structure that makes it possible to answer reachability questions.
That is, can one get from node a to node other node b in one or more hops?
A binary relation tells you only that node a is connected to node b, and that node b is connected to node c, etc.
After the transitive closure is constructed in an O(1) operation one may determine that node c is reachable from node a.

                    <text>Warshall’s algorithm can be used to construct the Transitive closure of directed graphs ().
In Warshall’s original formulation of the algorithm, the graph is unweighted and represented by a Boolean adjacency matrix.
Then the addition operation is replaced by logical conjunction (AND) and the minimum operation by logical disjunction (OR).

                    <text>I have followed a pattern ofimproving the problem solutions with different complexities (for each problem, you observe multiple solutionswith different improved complexities).
Basically, it’s an enumeration of possible solutions.
With this approach,even if we get a new question it gives us a way to think about all possible solutions.

We start with solution and slowly move towards the possible for that problem.
For each problemwe will try to understand how much time the algorithm is taking and how much memory the algorithm istaking.It is that, at least one complete reading of this book is required to get full understanding of allthe topics.

                    <text>Have a nice reading. - M-Tech, Founder of * ForewordWith the availability of different books on Data Structures and/or Algorithms, their design and analysis with ageneral or language based orientation; one would be in gross error to think that this book is one more to the list.Keeping in view the GATE and other competitive exams perspective in mind and critical time managementrequirement, the author has taken the approach of embedding theoretical concepts through efficient problemsolving.The different topics related to data structures and algorithms and their intricate interdependency have beendealt with comprehensive eloquence and subtle clarity.The topics coverage in the book spans from primitive to advanced data structures, their characteristics, theirspace and time complexity analysis, the different algorithmic paradigms/classifications, application areas andproblems and their analysis.Each topic is explained through a problem solving approach so that at the end, the reader is well equipped to beable to apply to any type of problem solving requirement and distinctly choose one strategy or type from theother.The book also includes solved GATE questions of last twenty years which works as a mock exam practice planefor the reader.
It is a very handy and must have book for any reader aiming for competitive exams of alluniversities and boards and as well as for campus recruitment.
It can also serve as a reference text-book forsoftware developers, who wanted to design and implement efficient algorithms. . , . * Table of Contents1.

All of us have solvedmany mathematical equations since childhood.
As an example, consider the below equation:We don’t have to worry about the use of above equation.

That means, the ( and ) are the place holdersfor representing data.
Similarly, in computer science we need something for holding data and are thefacility for doing that.1.2 Data typesIn the above equation, the variables and can take any values like integral numbers ( , etc...), real numbers( etc…) or just and .

                    <text>To solve the equation, we need to relate them to kind of values they can take and is the name being used in computer science for this purpose.A in a programming language is a set of data with values having predefined characteristics.
Examples ofdata types are: integer, floating point unit number, character, string etc...Computer memory is all filled with zeros and ones.
If we have a problem and wanted to code it, it’s very difficult toprovide the solution in terms of zeros and ones.

                    <text>A data type reduces the coding effort.
Basically, at the top level, there are two types of data types:  System defined data types (also called data types)  User defined data typesSystem defined data types (Primitive data types)Data types which are defined by system are called data types.
The primitive data types which are providedby many programming languages are: int, float, char, double, bool, etc… The number of bits allocated for eachprimitive data type depends on the programming languages, compiler and operating system.

Depending on the organizationof the elements, data structures are classified into two types: 1) Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially (say, Linked Lists). : Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues.
2) : Elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a non-linear order. : Trees and graphs.1.4 Abstract Data Types (ADTs)Before defining abstract data types, let us consider the different view of system defined data types.

For user defined data types also we need to defineoperations.
The implementation for these operations can be done when we want to actually use them.

They come in to picture only when we want touse them.
Different kinds of ADTs are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized tospecific tasks.

                    <text>When we create avariable (for example, in : ), the compiler allocates a block of contiguous memory locations and its size dependson the size of the variable.
The compiler also keeps an internal tag that associates the variable name with the addressof the first byte allocated to it (sometimes called as ).
So when we want to access that variable like this: , the compiler knows where that variable is located and it writes the value .

This isbecause of the fact that each variable type takes different amount of memory.
On a -bit computer for exampleusually an int needs bytes, while a short bytes.

                    <text>So in order to read the actual value stored there, the compiler has toknow how many consecutive memory locations to read in order to get the full value.Pointer Manipulation: Another very useful thing we can do with pointers is to perform arithmetic operations on them.This might be obvious to the careful reader, since we said that pointers are just integers.
However, there are a fewsmall differences on pointer arithmetic that make their use even more intuitive and easy.
Try the following code: char *cptr = (char*)2; printf(&quot;cptr before: %p &quot;, cptr); cptr++; printf(&quot;and after: %pn&quot;, cptr);We declare a pointer named and assign the address to it.

                    <text>We print the contents of the pointer (i.e. the address ), increment it, and print again.
Sure enough the first time it prints and then , and that was exactly what weexpected.
However try this one as well: int *iptr = (int*)2; printf(&quot;iptr before: %p &quot;, iptr); iptr++; printf(&quot;and after: %pn&quot;, iptr);Now the output, on my computer, is before: and after: Why does this pointer point to the address 6 afterincremented it by one and not to as the previous pointer?

                    <text>This means that if we have an int at the address , then that int occupiesthe memory locations and .
So in order to access to the next int we have to look at the address and .Thus when we add one to a pointer, it is not the same as adding one to any integer, it means give me a pointer to thenext variable which for variables of type int, in this case, is bytes ahead.The reason that in the first example with the char pointer, the actual address after incrementing, was one more thanthe previous address is because the size of char is exactly .
So the next char can indeed be found on the next address.Another limitation of void pointers is that we cannot perform arithmetic on them, since the compiler cannot knowhow many bytes ahead is the next variable located.

                    <text>So void pointers can only be used to keep addresses that we have toconvert later on to a specific pointer type, before using them.Arrays and Pointers: There is a strong connection between arrays and pointers.
So strong in fact, that most of the timewe can treat them as the same thing.
The name of an array can be considered just as a pointer to the beginning of amemory block as big as the array.

                    <text>So for example, making a pointer point to the beginning of an array is done inexactly the same way as assigning the contents of a pointer to another: short *ptr; short array[10]; ptr = array;and then we can access the contents of the array through the pointer as if the pointer itself was that array.
Forexample this: is perfectly legal.
Furthermore, we can treat the array itself as a pointer, for example, is equivalent to In general is equivalent to .The only difference between an array, and a pointer to the beginning of an array, is that the compiler keeps some extrainformation for the arrays, to keep track of their storage requirements.

                    <text>For example if we get the size of both an arrayand a pointer using the operator, sizeof(ptr) will give us how much space does the pointer itself occupies ( onmy computer), while sizeof array will give us, the amount of space occupied by the whole array (on my computer elements of bytes each).1.6 Pointers 13 * Data Structures and Algorithms For GATE Programming BasicsDynamic Memory Allocation: In the earlier sections, we have seen that pointers can hold addressed of anothervariables.
There is another use of pointers: pointers can hold addresses of memory locations that do not have a specificcompile-time variable name, but are allocated dynamically while the program runs (sometimes such memory is called ).To allocate memory during runtime, language provides us the facility interns of function.
This functionallocates the requested amount of memory, and returns a pointer to that memory.

                    <text>To deallocate that block of memory, supports it by providing function.
This function takes the pointer as an argument.
For example, in the belowcode, an array of 5 integers is allocated dynamically, and then deleted. int count = 5; int *A = malloc(count * sizeof(int)); ……… free(arr);In this example, the calculates the amount of bytes we need to allocate for the array, bymultiplying the number of elements, to the size of each element (i.e. the size of one integer).Function Pointers: Like data, executable code (including functions) also stored in memory.

                    <text>We can get the address of afunction.
But the question is what type of pointers we use for that purpose?In general, we use function pointers and they store the address of functions.
Using function pointers we can call thefunction indirectly.

                    <text>But, function pointers manipulation has limitation: limited to assignment and indirection andcannot do arithmetic on function pointers.
Because for function pointers there no ordering (functions can be storedanywhere in memory).
The following example illustrates how to create and use function pointers. int (*fptr)(int); fptr = function1; printf(&quot;function1of 0 is: %dn&quot;, fptr(5)); fptr = function2; printf(&quot;function2 of 0 is: %dn&quot;, fptr(10));First we create a pointer that can point to functions accepting an as an argument and returning int, named .Then we make point to the , and proceed to call it through the pointer, to print the of .

                    <text>Let the three pegs be A, B and C.
The goal is to move n pegs from A to C.
To move n discs from peg A to peg C: move n-1 discs from A to B.
This leaves disc n alone on peg A move disc n from A to C move n?1 discs from B to C so they sit on disc n The recurrence function T(n) for time complexity of the above recursive solution can be written as following.

                    <text>Consider the directed graph shown in the figure below.
There are multiple shortest paths between vertices S and T.
Which one will be reported by Dijstra?s shortest path algorithm?
Assume that, in any iteration, the shortest path to a vertex v is updated only when a strictly shorter path to v is discovered.

The purpose of this module is to provide students with a coherent introduction to techniques for using data structures and some basic algorithms, and with the tools for applying these techniques to computational problems.
Teaching and learning methods include lectures and reading material which describe techniques for analysing algorithms and applications of data structures, and a problem sheet which gives students an opportunity to practice problem solving.

                    <text>Page(s): 169 - 176 Product Type: Conference Publications * 570330 searchabstract * * * * * * Abstract Recently, the study of I/O-efficient algorithms has moved beyond fundamental problems of sorting and permuting and into wider areas such as computational geometry and graph algorithms.
With this expansion has come a need for new algorithmic techniques and data structures.
In this paper, we present I/O-efficient analogues of well-known data structures that we show to be useful for obtaining simpler and improved algorithms for several graph problems.

                    <text>Our results include improved algorithms for minimum spanning trees, breadth-first search, and single-source shortest paths.
The descriptions of these algorithms are greatly simplified by their use of well-defined I/O-efficient data structures with good amortized performance bounds.
We expect that I/O efficient data structures such as these will be a useful tool for the design-of I/O-efficient algorithms Index Terms * IEEE Terms Algorithm design and analysis , Communication networks , Computational geometry , Data structures , Parallel processing , Pressing , Read-write memory , Sorting , Throughput , Tree graphs * INSPEC * Controlled Indexing computational complexity , computational geometry , data structures , graph theory , parallel algorithms * Non Controlled Indexing I/O-efficient algorithms , amortized performance bounds , breadth-first search , data structures , external memory , graph problems , minimum spanning trees , single-source shortest paths   * Additional Details * References (7)

                    <text>I have followed a pattern ofimproving the problem solutions with different complexities (for each problem, you observe multiple solutionswith different improved complexities).
Basically, it’s an enumeration of possible solutions.
With this approach,even if we get a new question it gives us a way to think about all possible solutions.

We start with solution and slowly move towards the possible for that problem.
For each problemwe will try to understand how much time the algorithm is taking and how much memory the algorithm istaking.It is that, at least one complete reading of this book is required to get full understanding of allthe topics.

                    <text>Have a nice reading. - M-Tech, Founder of * ForewordWith the availability of different books on Data Structures and/or Algorithms, their design and analysis with ageneral or language based orientation; one would be in gross error to think that this book is one more to the list.Keeping in view the GATE and other competitive exams perspective in mind and critical time managementrequirement, the author has taken the approach of embedding theoretical concepts through efficient problemsolving.The different topics related to data structures and algorithms and their intricate interdependency have beendealt with comprehensive eloquence and subtle clarity.The topics coverage in the book spans from primitive to advanced data structures, their characteristics, theirspace and time complexity analysis, the different algorithmic paradigms/classifications, application areas andproblems and their analysis.Each topic is explained through a problem solving approach so that at the end, the reader is well equipped to beable to apply to any type of problem solving requirement and distinctly choose one strategy or type from theother.The book also includes solved GATE questions of last twenty years which works as a mock exam practice planefor the reader.
It is a very handy and must have book for any reader aiming for competitive exams of alluniversities and boards and as well as for campus recruitment.
It can also serve as a reference text-book forsoftware developers, who wanted to design and implement efficient algorithms. . , . * Table of Contents1.

All of us have solvedmany mathematical equations since childhood.
As an example, consider the below equation:We don’t have to worry about the use of above equation.

Examples ofdata types are: integer, floating point unit number, character, string etc...Computer memory is all filled with zeros and ones.
If we have a problem and wanted to code it, it’s very difficult toprovide the solution in terms of zeros and ones.

Basically, at the top level, there are two types of data types:  System defined data types (also called data types)  User defined data typesSystem defined data types (Primitive data types)Data types which are defined by system are called data types.
The primitive data types which are providedby many programming languages are: int, float, char, double, bool, etc… The number of bits allocated for eachprimitive data type depends on the programming languages, compiler and operating system.

Depending on the organizationof the elements, data structures are classified into two types: 1) Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially (say, Linked Lists). : Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues.
2) : Elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a non-linear order. : Trees and graphs.1.4 Abstract Data Types (ADTs)Before defining abstract data types, let us consider the different view of system defined data types.

For user defined data types also we need to defineoperations.
The implementation for these operations can be done when we want to actually use them.

                    <text>So in order to read the actual value stored there, the compiler has toknow how many consecutive memory locations to read in order to get the full value.Pointer Manipulation: Another very useful thing we can do with pointers is to perform arithmetic operations on them.This might be obvious to the careful reader, since we said that pointers are just integers.
However, there are a fewsmall differences on pointer arithmetic that make their use even more intuitive and easy.
Try the following code: char *cptr = (char*)2; printf(&quot;cptr before: %p &quot;, cptr); cptr++; printf(&quot;and after: %pn&quot;, cptr);We declare a pointer named and assign the address to it.

                    <text>We print the contents of the pointer (i.e. the address ), increment it, and print again.
Sure enough the first time it prints and then , and that was exactly what weexpected.
However try this one as well: int *iptr = (int*)2; printf(&quot;iptr before: %p &quot;, iptr); iptr++; printf(&quot;and after: %pn&quot;, iptr);Now the output, on my computer, is before: and after: Why does this pointer point to the address 6 afterincremented it by one and not to as the previous pointer?

                    <text>This means that if we have an int at the address , then that int occupiesthe memory locations and .
So in order to access to the next int we have to look at the address and .Thus when we add one to a pointer, it is not the same as adding one to any integer, it means give me a pointer to thenext variable which for variables of type int, in this case, is bytes ahead.The reason that in the first example with the char pointer, the actual address after incrementing, was one more thanthe previous address is because the size of char is exactly .
So the next char can indeed be found on the next address.Another limitation of void pointers is that we cannot perform arithmetic on them, since the compiler cannot knowhow many bytes ahead is the next variable located.

                    <text>So void pointers can only be used to keep addresses that we have toconvert later on to a specific pointer type, before using them.Arrays and Pointers: There is a strong connection between arrays and pointers.
So strong in fact, that most of the timewe can treat them as the same thing.
The name of an array can be considered just as a pointer to the beginning of amemory block as big as the array.

                    <text>So for example, making a pointer point to the beginning of an array is done inexactly the same way as assigning the contents of a pointer to another: short *ptr; short array[10]; ptr = array;and then we can access the contents of the array through the pointer as if the pointer itself was that array.
Forexample this: is perfectly legal.
Furthermore, we can treat the array itself as a pointer, for example, is equivalent to In general is equivalent to .The only difference between an array, and a pointer to the beginning of an array, is that the compiler keeps some extrainformation for the arrays, to keep track of their storage requirements.

                    <text>For example if we get the size of both an arrayand a pointer using the operator, sizeof(ptr) will give us how much space does the pointer itself occupies ( onmy computer), while sizeof array will give us, the amount of space occupied by the whole array (on my computer elements of bytes each).1.6 Pointers 13 * Data Structures and Algorithms For GATE Programming BasicsDynamic Memory Allocation: In the earlier sections, we have seen that pointers can hold addressed of anothervariables.
There is another use of pointers: pointers can hold addresses of memory locations that do not have a specificcompile-time variable name, but are allocated dynamically while the program runs (sometimes such memory is called ).To allocate memory during runtime, language provides us the facility interns of function.
This functionallocates the requested amount of memory, and returns a pointer to that memory.

                    <text>To deallocate that block of memory, supports it by providing function.
This function takes the pointer as an argument.
For example, in the belowcode, an array of 5 integers is allocated dynamically, and then deleted. int count = 5; int *A = malloc(count * sizeof(int)); ……… free(arr);In this example, the calculates the amount of bytes we need to allocate for the array, bymultiplying the number of elements, to the size of each element (i.e. the size of one integer).Function Pointers: Like data, executable code (including functions) also stored in memory.

Because for function pointers there no ordering (functions can be storedanywhere in memory).
The following example illustrates how to create and use function pointers. int (*fptr)(int); fptr = function1; printf(&quot;function1of 0 is: %dn&quot;, fptr(5)); fptr = function2; printf(&quot;function2 of 0 is: %dn&quot;, fptr(10));First we create a pointer that can point to functions accepting an as an argument and returning int, named .Then we make point to the , and proceed to call it through the pointer, to print the of .

The function func receives copies of thesevalues and accesses them by the identifiers a and b.
The function func changes the value of a.

In main, x = 5 y = 7Pass by Result: This method uses out-mode semantics.
A formal parameter is a new local variable that exists within thescope of the function.

                    <text>My goal in writing this text is to provide a practical introduction to data structures and algorithms, from the viewpoint of abstract thinking and problem solving, as well as to the use of C++.
I try to cover all important details concerning the data structures, the analyses, and their C++ implementations, and have stayed away from data structures that are theoretically interesting but not widely used.

                    <text>I have designed the textbook to allow flexibility in topic coverage for the instructor.
It is impossible to cover all the C++ details, all the different data structures, and all the mathematics described in the text in a single course.
The instructor will need to decide on an appropriate balance between practice, theory, and level of C++ detail.

                    <text>Approach The most unique aspect of the text is the clear separation of the interface and implementation.
In C++ the class mechanism allows the programmer to write the interface and implementation separately, to place them in separate files and compile separately, and to hide implementation details.

                    <text>In this textbook we take this a step further: The interface and implementation are discussed in separate parts of the book.
Parts I, II, and III lay the groundwork, discussing basic concepts and tools and providing some practical examples, but implementation of the basic data structures are not shown until Part IV.
This is the first CS-2 textbook to take this approach.

                    <text>The separation of interface and implementation provides several benefits.
Generally, it promotes abstract thinking: Class interfaces are written and used before the implementation is known, and it forces the reader to think about the functionality and potential efficiency of the various data structures.

                    <text>For example, programs that use a hash table are written hundreds of pages before the hash table is implemented.
The proposed standard template library (STL) for C++ (which is likely to be mimicked in Ada and other languages) provides classes for stacks, queues, and almost all the fundamental data structures.
We believe it will hasten the shift in emphasis of data structures courses from implemention to use.

Appendix A contains a review of this material.
Students that have had a first course using C++ should be able to start at Chapter 1.

Students whose first course was neither C nor C++ will need to read Appendix A carefully.
In any event, this textbook is not about C++; it is about data structures and algorithm design, which is the proper focus of a CS-2 course.
Readers who are not fluent C++ programmers should have a C++ reference book available; some recommendations are listed in Chapter 1.

                    <text>Discrete math is not a prerequisite.
Mathematical proofs are relatively rare (except towards the end of the text), and when done they are usually preceded by a brief math review.
However, establishing some of our claims requires proof; Chapters 7 and 18 through 23 require some degree of mathematical sophistication.
The instructor may elect to skip mathematical aspects of the proofs by presenting only the results.
All proofs in the text are clearly marked and are separate from the body of the text.

                    <text>C++ Using C++ presents both advantages and disadvantages.
The C++ class allows the separation of interface and implementation, as well as the hiding of internal details of the implementation.
It cleanly supports the notion of abstraction.
However, other languages support this also, notably Turbo Pascal and Ada.

                    <text>The disadvantage of C++ is that it is far from a perfect language pedagogically, especially in a second course, and thus additional care needs to be expended to avoid bad programming practices.
A second disadvantage is that C++ is still not a stable language, so the various compilers behave differently.

                    <text>It might have been preferable to write the book in a language-independent fashion, concentrating only on general principles such as the theory of the data structures and referring to C++ code only in passing, but that is impossible.
C++ code is complex, and readers will need to see complete examples to understand some of the finer points.
As mentioned earlier, a brief review of the simpler parts of C++ is provided in Appendix A. Part I of the book describes some of C++'s more advanced features relevant to data structures.

The approach to this material is as follows:

                    <text>Templates: Templates are used extensively.
Some readers may have reservations with this approach because it complicates the code, but I have included them because they are fundamental concepts in any sophisticated C++ program.

The main instance in which it is used is to derive implementations of data structures from abstract specifications.

                    <text>Exceptions: At the time of this writing, development of exceptions is several years behind that of templates.
They are not universally implemented, and the exact semantics have yet to be standardized.
Eventually they will be standardized, they will work, and they will be widely used.

                    <text>In recognition of this, my preference would have been to include them, but except for the handling of memory exhaustion, this is not possible right now.
Consequently, exceptions are not otherwise used in the code.
However, throughout the text we use the function EXCEPTION, described in Appendix D, to signal points at which an exception could be used.
Appendix D also describes how to incorporate exceptions into the code should they be available on your compiler.

                    <text>Part II discusses Big-Oh and algorithmic paradigms, including recursion and randomization.
Sorting is covered in a full chapter, and basic data structures are described in another chapter.
The interfaces and running times of the data structures are presented without giving the implementations.
The instructor then may take several approaches to present the remaining material.
Two of these are:

Chapter 6 is a crucial chapter that discusses the interface to the data structures and argues intuitively what the running time of the supported operations should be for each data structure.
However, implementation of these data structures is not provided until Part IV.

                    <text>Course Organization Ignoring factors such as the balance between theory and practice, the crucial issue in teaching the course is deciding how the materials in Parts II to IV are to be used.
The material in Part I should be covered in depth, and the student should write one or two programs that illustrate the design, implementation, and testing of classes and template classes, and depending on how much C++ is desired to be taught, inheritance.
Next, Chapter 5 discusses Big-Oh, and an exercise in which the student writes a short program and compares the running time with an analysis can be given to test comprehension.

                    <text>In the separation approach, the key concept of Chapter 6 is simply the fact that different data structures support different access schemes with different efficiency.
Students can be asked first to write an inefficient data structure.
Any case study (except the tic-tac-toe example that uses recursion) can be used to test their programs, and the students can compare their inefficient data structures with an efficient library routine (provided by anonymous ftp, as discussed below).

In this way we see the interface for each data structure, and we see how it is used, but we do not see how it is efficiently implemented.

The details of sorting can be discussed at any point after recursion.
At this point the course can continue by using the same case studies and experimenting with modifications to the implementations of the data structures.
For instance, the student can experiment with various forms of balanced binary search trees.

                    <text>My editor Carter Shanklin helped me refine my thinking and his assistant Christine Kulke kept everything flowing smoothly.
Craig Johnson, Production Technology Supervisor, was especially helpful with my Frame questions.
I would especially like to thank the people involved in the production of the text: Barbara Conway did a wonderful job of copyediting the manuscript and suggesting improvements throughout; Teri Holden was a fantastic production editor; Holly McLean-Aldis did a great job proofreading; and Lisa Jahred wrote the templates for the book design.

                    <text>From the Back Cover Algorithms, Data Structures, and Problem Solving with C++ is the first CS2 textbook that clearly separates the interface and implementation of data structures.
The interface and running time of data structures are presented first, and students have the opportunity to use the data structures in a host of practical examples before being introduced to the implementations.
This unique approach enhances the ability of students to think abstractly.Features Retains an emphasis on data structures and algorithm design while using C++ as the language of implementation.

                    <text>The book is a good textbook, but not a good desk reference.
The book is obviously written with students in mind, using rhetorical questions, leaving vital areas unexplained as &quot;exercises for the reader&quot;, etc.

                    <text>As an introductory text, in an introductory class, the book served its purpose, though the professor was required to explain some of the details that the book lacked.
The code that is included in the book is all written in pseudo-code, most of it does not compile without some tweaking, and when a student is trying to grasp a diffucult concept in graph theory, the last thing that student wants is to have to trace through the program, line-by-line, to catch some error that is irrelevant to the larger problem, such as semicolons that have been left out, unmatched parenthesis, variable names that are not allowed by most of the commercial compilers.

                    <text>The book does have a good learning curve, however, and makes for good reading when first approaching a new computer science concept; however, when having to program a particularly hard section of a certain data structure, wading through pages of diatribe against older methods is not what is needed at that time.

                    <text>For instance, after spending a large portion of an entire chapter on AVL trees, Weiss proceeds to give example code (that doesn't compile on Borland 5.0, Visual C++, or GNU compilers without some tweaking), but leaves out a crucial method!
When first learning about AVL trees, one of the lessons that was drilled into our heads was the diffuculty of AVL deletion... yet the book summed it up in *one* sentence: &quot;As with most data structures, deletion is the hardest task; it is left as an exercise to the reader.&quot;

Stay away from this book if you are new to advanced data types or algorithm analysis.

The interviewer wants someone who can solve these kinds of problems, so you'll just have to familiarise yourself with the available arrays/trees/hashes etc in the languages you program, along with common searching and sorting algorithms, and possibly graph structures/algorithms too if you're seeing them.

If I can see that you know how to approach the problem, that demonstrates the ability to work out problems, which is usually the goal.

Usually if its not an acceptable answer I will continue to prod and hint at the direction I am looking for.

This skill is a fundamental component and has uses beyond just passing the interview.

That's akin to asking how to know how to makethings with materials.

The interviewer is (likely) trying to get a feel for how you think.
There may be some that are looking for &quot;book answers&quot; too, unfortunately.

                    <text>Introduction¶ Objectives¶ * To review the ideas of computer science, programming, and problem-solving. * To understand abstraction and the role it plays in the problem-solving process. * To understand and implement the notion of an abstract data type. * To review the Python programming language.
Getting Started¶ The way we think about programming has undergone many changes in the years since the first electronic computers required patch cables and switches to convey instructions from human to machine.
As is the case with many aspects of society, changes in computing technology provide computer scientists with a growing number of tools and platforms on which to practice their craft.

                    <text>Advances such as faster processors, high-speed networks, and large memory capacities have created a spiral of complexity through which computer scientists must navigate.
Throughout all of this rapid evolution, a number of basic principles have remained constant.
The science of computing is concerned with using computers to solve problems.

                    <text>You have no doubt spent considerable time learning the basics of problem-solving and hopefully feel confident in your ability to take a problem statement and develop a solution.
You have also learned that writing computer programs is often hard.
The complexity of large problems and the corresponding complexity of the solutions can tend to overshadow the fundamental ideas related to the problem-solving process.

                    <text>This chapter emphasizes two important areas for the rest of the text.
First, it reviews the framework within which computer science and the study of algorithms and data structures must fit, in particular, the reasons why we need to study these topics and how understanding these topics helps us to become better problem solvers.

                    <text>What Is Computer Science?¶ Computer science is often difficult to define.
This is probably due to the unfortunate use of the word “computer&quot; in the name.
As you are perhaps aware, computer science is not simply the study of computers.
Although computers play an important supporting role as a tool in the discipline, they are just that–tools.

                    <text>Computer science is the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that come out of the problem-solving process.
Given a problem, a computer scientist’s goal is to develop analgorithm, a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise.
Algorithms are finite processes that if followed will solve the problem.
Algorithms are solutions.

                    <text>Computer science can be thought of as the study of algorithms.
However, we must be careful to include the fact that some problems may not have a solution.

                    <text>Although proving this statement is beyond the scope of this text, the fact that some problems cannot be solved is important for those who study computer science.
We can fully define computer science, then, by including both types of problems and stating that computer science is the study of solutions to problems as well as the study of problems with no solutions.

                <section>
                    <text>An alternative definition for computer science, then, is to say that computer science is the study of problems that are and that are not computable, the study of the existence and the nonexistence of algorithms.
In any case, you will note that the word “computer&quot; did not come up at all.
Solutions are considered independent from the machine.

                    <text>Computer science, as it pertains to the problem-solving process itself, is also the study ofabstraction.
Abstraction allows us to view the problem and solution in such a way as to separate the so-called logical and physical perspectives.
The basic idea is familiar to us in a common example.

As a driver, a user of the car, you have certain interactions that take place in order to utilize the car for its intended purpose.
You get in, insert the key, start the car, shift, brake, accelerate, and steer in order to drive.

You are using the functions provided by the car designers for the purpose of transporting you from one location to another.
These functions are sometimes also referred to as theinterface.

She not only knows how to drive but must know all of the details necessary to carry out all the functions that we take for granted.
She needs to understand how the engine works, how the transmission shifts gears, how temperature is controlled, and so on.
This is known as the physical perspective, the details that take place “under the hood.&quot;

They view computers from a logical or user perspective.

They must know the details of how operating systems work, how network protocols are configured, and how to code various scripts that control function.
They must be able to control the low-level details that a user simply assumes.

This interface is the way we as users communicate with the underlying complexities of the implementation.

                    <text>As another example of abstraction, consider the Python math module.
Once we import the module, we can perform computations such as &gt;&gt;&gt; import math &gt;&gt;&gt; math.sqrt(16) 4.0 &gt;&gt;&gt; This is an example of procedural abstraction.
We do not necessarily know how the square root is being calculated, but we know what the function is called and how to use it.

                    <text>If we perform the import correctly, we can assume that the function will provide us with the correct results.
We know that someone implemented a solution to the square root problem but we only need to know how to use it.
This is sometimes referred to as a “black box&quot; view of a process.
We simply describe the interface: the name of the function, what is needed (the parameters), and what will be returned.
The details are hidden inside (Figure 1 ).

                    <text>Procedural Abstraction – test What Is Programming?¶ Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer.
Although many programming languages and many different types of computers exist, the important first step is the need to have the solution.
Without an algorithm there can be no program.

                    <text>Computer science is not the study of programming.
Programming, however, is an important part of what a computer scientist does.
Programming is often the way that we create a representation for our solutions.
Therefore, this language representation and the process of creating it becomes a fundamental part of the discipline.

Programming languages must provide a notational way to represent both the process and the data.
To this end, languages provide control constructs and data types.

As long as the language provides these basic statements, it can be used for algorithm representation.

In order to give these strings meaning, we need to havedata types.
Data types provide an interpretation for this binary data so that we can think about the data in terms that make sense with respect to the problem being solved.
These low-level, built-in data types (sometimes called the primitive data types) provide the building blocks for algorithm development.

These simple, language-provided constructs and data types, although certainly sufficient to represent complex solutions, are typically at a disadvantage as we work through the problem-solving process.
We need ways to control this complexity and assist with the creation of solutions.

                    <text>Why Study Data Structures and Abstract Data Types?¶ To manage the complexity of problems and the problem-solving process, computer scientists use abstractions to allow them to focus on the “big picture&quot; without getting lost in the details.
By creating models of the problem domain, we are able to utilize a better and more efficient problem-solving process.
These models allow us to describe the data that our algorithms will manipulate in a much more consistent way with respect to the problem itself.

                    <text>Earlier, we referred to procedural abstraction as a process that hides the details of a particular function to allow the user or client to view it at a very high level.
We now turn our attention to a similar idea, that ofdata abstraction.
An abstract data type, sometimes abbreviated ADT, is a logical description of how we view the data and the operations that are allowed without regard to how they will be implemented.

                    <text>This means that we are concerned only with what the data is representing and not with how it will eventually be constructed.
By providing this level of abstraction, we are creating an encapsulation around the data.
The idea is that by encapsulating the details of the implementation, we are hiding them from the user’s view.
This is called information hiding.

                    <text>Abstract Data Type The implementation of an abstract data type, often referred to as a data structure, will require that we provide a physical view of the data using some collection of programming constructs and primitive data types.
As we discussed earlier, the separation of these two perspectives will allow us to define the complex data models for our problems without giving any indication as to the details of how the model will actually be built.

Since there will usually be many different ways to implement an abstract data type, this implementation independence allows the programmer to switch the details of the implementation without changing the way the user of the data interacts with it.
The user can remain focused on the problem-solving process.

                    <text>Why Study Algorithms?¶ Computer scientists learn by experience.
We learn by seeing others solve problems and by solving problems by ourselves.
Being exposed to different problem-solving techniques and seeing how different algorithms are designed helps us to take on the next challenging problem that we are given.
By considering a number of different algorithms, we can begin to develop pattern recognition so that the next time a similar problem arises, we are better able to solve it.

One algorithm may use many fewer resources than another.

As we study algorithms, we can learn analysis techniques that allow us to compare and contrast solutions based solely on their own characteristics, not the characteristics of the program or computer used to implement them.

This means that Python considers data to be the focal point of the problem-solving process.
In Python, as well as in any other object-oriented programming language, we define aclass to be a description of what the data look like (the state) and what the data can do (the behavior).

Other very useful operations are the remainder (modulo) operator, %, and integer division, //.
Note that when two integers are divided, the result is a floating point.
The integer division operator returns the integer portion of the quotient by truncating any fractional part.

In Python, identifiers start with a letter or an underscore (_), are case sensitive, and can be of any length.
Remember that it is always a good idea to use names that convey meaning so that your program code is easier to read and understand.

                    <text>A Python variable is created when a name is used for the first time on the left-hand side of an assignment statement.
Assignment statements provide a way to associate a name with a value.
The variable will hold a reference to a piece of data and not the data itself.
Consider the following session:

In general, the right-hand side of the assignment statement is evaluated and a reference to the resulting data object is “assigned&quot; to the name on the left-hand side.
At this point in our example, the type of the variable is integer as that is the type of the data currently being referred to bythesum.

                    <text>If the type of the data changes (seeFigure 4 ), as shown above with the boolean valueTrue, so does the type of the variable ( thesum is now of the type boolean).
The assignment statement changes the reference being held by the variable.
This is a dynamic characteristic of Python.
The same variable can refer to many different types of data.

Lists, strings, and tuples are ordered collections that are very similar in general structure but have specific differences that must be understood for them to be used properly.
Sets and dictionaries are unordered collections.

                    <text>A list is an ordered collection of zero or more references to Python data objects.
Lists are written as comma-delimited values enclosed in square brackets.
The empty list is simply[ ].
Lists are heterogeneous, meaning that the data objects need not all be from the same class and the collection can be assigned to a variable as below.
The following fragment shows a variety of Python data objects in a list.

Note that when Python evaluates a list, the list itself is returned.
However, in order to remember the list for later processing, its reference needs to be assigned to a variable.

                    <text>Sometimes, you will want to initialize a list.
This can quickly be accomplished by using repetition.
For example, &gt;&gt;&gt; myList = [0] * 6 &gt;&gt;&gt; myList [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
One very important aside relating to the repetition operator is that the result is a repetition of references to the data objects in the sequence.
This can best be seen by considering the following session:

If no division is specified, the split method looks for whitespace characters such as tab, newline and space.

                    <text>Lists are mutable; strings are immutable.
For example, you can change an item in a list by using indexing and assignment.
With a string that change is not allowed.

The difference is that a tuple is immutable, like a string.
A tuple cannot be changed.

Dictionaries are collections of associated pairs of items where each pair consists of a key and a value.
This key-value pair is typically written as key:value.

For example, &gt;&gt;&gt; capitals = {'Iowa':'DesMoines','Wisconsin':'Madison'} &gt;&gt;&gt; capitals {'Wisconsin': 'Madison', 'Iowa': 'DesMoines'} &gt;&gt;&gt; We can manipulate a dictionary by accessing a value via its key or by adding another key-value pair.
The syntax for access looks much like a sequence access except that instead of using the index of the item we use the key value.
To add a new value is similar.

The first pair added ('Utah': 'SaltLakeCity') was placed first in the dictionary and the second pair added ('California': 'Sacramento') was placed last.
The placement of a key is dependent on the idea of “hashing,&quot; which will be explained in more detail in Chapter 4.
We also show the length function performing the same role as with previous collections.

While Python does have a way to create dialog boxes, there is a much simpler function that we can use.
Python provides us with a function that allows us to ask a user to enter some data and returns a reference to the data in the form of a string.
The function is calledinput.

                    <text>Python’s input function takes a single parameter that is a string.
This string is often called the {prompt} because it contains some helpful text prompting the user to enter something.
For example, you might call input as follows:

                    <text>aName = input('Please enter your name: ') Now whatever the user types after the prompt will be stored in theaName variable.
Using the input function, we can easily write instructions that will prompt the user to enter data and then incorporate that data into further processing.
For example, in the following two statements, the first asks the user for their name and the second prints the result of some simple processing based on the string that is provided.

                    <text>The left side of the expression holds the template or format string, and the right side holds a collection of values that will be substituted into the format string.
Note that the number of values in the collection on the right side corresponds with the number of% characters in the format string.
Values are taken—in order, left to right—from the collection and inserted into the format string.

The format string may contain one or more conversion specifications.
A conversion character tells the format operator what type of value is going to be inserted into that position in the string.

If the collection is a tuple, the values are inserted in order of position.
That is, the first element in the tuple corresponds to the first format character in the format string.
If the collection is a dictionary, the values are inserted according to their keys.
In this case all format characters must use the(name) modifier to specify the name of the key.

                    <text>Control Structures¶ As we noted earlier, algorithms require two important control structures: iteration and selection.
Both of these are supported by Python in various forms.
The programmer can choose the statement that is most useful for the given circumstance.

                    <text>For iteration, Python provides a standard while statement and a very powerful for statement.
The while statement repeats a body of code as long as a condition is true.
For example, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11&gt;&gt;&gt; counter = 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; while counter &lt;= 5: ... print( &quot;Hello, world&quot;) ... counter = counter + 1 Hello, world Hello, world Hello, world Hello, world Hello, world prints out the phrase “Hello, world&quot; five times.

If the condition isTrue, the body of the statement will execute.
It is easy to see the structure of a Pythonwhile statement due to the mandatory indentation pattern that the language enforces.

The value of the variablecounter would need to be less than or equal to 10 and the value of the variabledone would need to be False (not False is True) so that True and True results in True.

Thefor statement can be used to iterate over the members of a collection, so long as the collection is a sequence.
So, for example, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in [1,3,6,2,5]: ... print(item) ...

0 1 4 9 16 &gt;&gt;&gt; will perform the print function five times.
The range function will return a range object representing the sequence 0,1,2,3,4 and each value will be assigned to the variableitem.
This value is then squared and printed.

                    <text>The general syntax for a list comprehension also allows a selection criteria to be added so that only certain items get added.
For example, &gt;&gt;&gt; sqlist=[x*x for x in range(1,11) if x%2 != 0] &gt;&gt;&gt; sqlist [1, 9, 25, 49, 81] &gt;&gt;&gt; This list comprehension constructed a list that only contained the squares of the odd numbers in the range from 1 to 10.
Any sequence that supports iteration can be used within a list comprehension to construct a new list.

The first, known as a syntax error, simply means that the programmer has made a mistake in the structure of a statement or expression.
For example, it is incorrect to write a for statement and forget the colon.

In addition, programmers can create their own exceptions if they detect a situation in the program execution that warrants it.

If the user enters a value that is greater than or equal to 0, the print will show the square root.
However, if the user enters a negative value, the square root function will report a ValueError exception.

                    <text>Defining Functions¶ The earlier example of procedural abstraction called upon a Python function calledsqrt from the math module to compute the square root.
In general, we can hide the details of any computation by defining a function.
A function definition requires a name, a group of parameters, and a body.
It may also explicitly return a value.
For example, the simple function defined below returns the square of the value you pass into it.

For this function, n is the only formal parameter, which suggests thatsquare needs only one piece of data to do its work.

Note that the call to square returns an integer that can in turn be passed to another invocation.

                    <text>We could implement our own square root function by using a well-known technique called “Newton’s Method.&quot;
Newton’s Method for approximating square roots performs an iterative computation that converges on the correct value.
The equation\(newguess = \frac {1}{2} * (oldguess + \frac {n}{oldguess})\) takes a value\(n\) and repeatedly guesses the square root by making each \(newguess\) the \(oldguess\) in the subsequent iteration.
The initial guess used here is\(\frac {n}{2}\).

Again, the details of Newton’s Method are hidden inside the function definition and the user does not have to know anything about the implementation to use the function for its intended purpose.
Listing 1 also shows the use of the # character as a comment marker.
Any characters that follow the # on a line are ignored.

Whenever we want to implement an abstract data type, we will do so with a new class.

                    <text>A fraction such as \(\frac {3}{5}\) consists of two parts.
The top value, known as the numerator, can be any integer.
The bottom value, called the denominator, can be any integer greater than 0 (negative fractions have a negative numerator).
Although it is possible to create a floating point approximation for any fraction, in this case we would like to represent the fraction as an exact value.

                    <text>The operations for the Fraction type will allow a Fraction data object to behave like any other numeric value.
We need to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions.
We also want to be able to show fractions using the standard “slash&quot; form, for example 3/5.
In addition, all fraction methods should return results in their lowest terms so that no matter what computation is performed, we always end up with the most common form.

For this example, class Fraction: #the methods go here provides the framework for us to define the methods.
The first method that all classes should provide is the constructor.

It must always be the first formal parameter; however, it will never be given an actual parameter value upon invocation.

                    <text>To create an instance of the Fraction class, we must invoke the constructor.
This happens by using the name of the class and passing actual values for the necessary state (note that we never directlyinvoke __init__).
For example, myfraction = Fraction(3,5) creates an object called myfraction representing the fraction\(\frac {3}{5}\) (three-fifths).
Figure 5 shows this object as it is now implemented.

Unfortunately, this does not work in general.
In order to make printing work properly, we need to tell the Fraction class how to convert itself into a string.
This is what the print function needs in order to do its job.

For example, f1.__add__(f2) would ask the Fraction object f1 to add the Fraction object f2 to itself.
This can be written in the standard notation,f1+f2.

To put a fraction in lowest terms, we will divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.
So, for the fraction\(6/8\), the greatest common divisor is 2.
Dividing the top and the bottom by 2 creates a new fraction, \(3/4\) (see Listing 7 ).

Two different objects with the same numerators and denominators would not be equal under this implementation.

                    <text>Shallow Equality Versus Deep Equality We can create deep equality (see Figure 7 )–equality by the same value, not the same reference–by overriding the__eq__ method.
The__eq__ method is another standard method available in any class.
The __eq__ method compares two objects and returns True if their values are the same,False otherwise.

It is important to note that there are other relational operators that can be overridden.
For example, the__le__ method provides the less than or equal functionality.

This is often referred to as anIS-A Relationship (the list IS-A sequential collection).
This implies that lists inherit important characteristics from sequences, namely the ordering of the underlying data and operations such as concatenation, repetition, and indexing.

                    <text>Three Types of Logic Gates By combining these gates in various patterns and then applying a set of input values, we can build circuits that have logical functions.Figure 10 shows a circuit consisting of two AND gates, one OR gate, and a single NOT gate.
The output lines from the two AND gates feed directly into the OR gate, and the resulting output from the OR gate is given to the NOT gate.
If we apply a set of input values to the four input lines (two for each AND gate), the values are processed and a result appears at the output of the NOT gate.Figure 10 also shows an example with values.

Below that, the specific logic functions of each appear.

                    <text>The other behavior that every logic gate needs is the ability to know its output value.
This will require that the gate perform the appropriate logic based on the current input.
In order to produce output, the gate needs to know specifically what that logic is.
This means calling a method to perform the logic computation.
The complete class is shown inListing 10 .

                    <text>The only behavior that the BinaryGate class adds is the ability to get the values from the two input lines.
Since these values come from some external place, we will simply ask the user via an input statement to provide them.
The same implementation occurs for theUnaryGate class except that there is only one input line.

For example, the AndGate class will be a subclass of BinaryGate since AND gates have two input lines.

Note that the AndGate class does not provide any new data since it inherits two input lines, one output line, and a label.

This is the place where we can provide theperformGateLogic method.
For an AND gate, this method first must get the two input values and then only return 1 if both input values are 1.
The complete class is shown inListing 11 .

Once the values are provided, the correct output is shown.

In order to create a circuit, we need to connect gates together, the output of one flowing into the input of another.
To do this, we will implement a new class calledConnector.

It will, however, use the gate hierarchy in that each connector will have two gates, one on either end (seeFigure 12 ).
This relationship is very important in object-oriented programming.
It is called theHAS-A Relationship.
Recall earlier that we used the phrase “IS-A Relationship&quot; to say that a child class is related to a parent class, for exampleUnaryGate IS-A LogicGate.

When designing classes, it is very important to distinguish between those that have the IS-A relationship (which requires inheritance) and those that have HAS-A relationships (with no inheritance).

The two gate instances within each connector object will be referred to as thefromgate and the togate, recognizing that data values will “flow&quot; from the output of one gate into an input line of the next.
The call tosetNextPin is very important for making connections (see Listing x ).
We need to add this method to our gate classes so that eachtogate can choose the proper input line for the connection.

This requires a change to thegetPinA and getPinB methods (see Listing 13 ).

One of the sophisticated skills that a software professional needs is to choose suitable data structures for developing programming solution of a given problem.

                    <text>Selection of a particular data structure greatly influences the characteristics of the obtained solution that include efficiency (performance, or speed), space (memory) requirements, scalability, reuse, and robustness (or reliability).
The other equally important skill is to choose a suitable problem solving technique to apply to a particular problem.
Acquiring these skills, early during the curriculum, greatly enhances the problem solving skills of the learner.

                    <text>More precisely, an algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list[1] of well-defined instructions[2] for calculating afunction .[3]
Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhapsempty ),[4] the instructions describe acomputation that, when executed , proceeds through a finite[5] number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing &quot;output&quot;[6] and terminating at a final ending state.
The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic ; some algorithms, known asrandomized algorithms , incorporate random input.[ 7]

                    <text>Though al-Khwārizmī 's algorism referred to the rules of performing arithmetic using Hindu-Arabic numerals and the systematic solution of linear andquadratic equations , a partial formalization of what would become the modernalgorithm began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (the &quot;decision problem&quot;) posed byDavid Hilbert in 1928.
Subsequent formalizations were framed as attempts to define &quot;effective calculability &quot;[8] or &quot;effective method&quot;;[9] those formalizations included theGödel –Herbrand –Kleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935,Alonzo Church 's lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post 's &quot;Formulation 1 &quot; of 1936, and Alan Turing 's Turing machines of 1936–7 and 1939.
Giving a formal definition of algorithms, corresponding to the intuitive notion, remains a challenging problem.[10]

While there is no generally acceptedformal definition of &quot;algorithm,&quot; an informal definition could be &quot;a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations.&quot;[11]
For some people, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually; for others, a program is only an algorithm if it stops before a given number of calculation steps.[12]

But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can giveexplicit instructions for determining the nth member of the set, for arbitrary finiten.
Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in whichthey could be followed by a computing machine, or by a human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.[13]

                    <text>The term &quot;enumerably infinite&quot; means &quot;countable using integers perhaps extending to infinity.&quot;
Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that &quot;creates&quot; output integers from an arbitrary &quot;input&quot; integer or integers that, in theory, can be chosen from 0 to infinity.

                    <text>That notion is central for explaining howformal systems come into being starting from a small set ofaxioms and rules.
In logic , the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related with our customary physical dimension.
From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition ofalgorithm that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.

                    <text>Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards.
Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by aTuring-complete system.
Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):

                    <text>Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data is read from an input source, written to an output device, and/or stored for further processing.
Stored data is regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm.
In practice, the state is stored in one or moredata structures .

                    <text>So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises ofimperative programming .
This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, &quot;mechanical&quot; means.
Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is theassignment operation , setting the value of a variable.
It derives from the intuition of &quot;memory &quot; as a scratchpad.
There is an example below of such an assignment.

                    <text>Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms.
Pseudocode, flowcharts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements.
Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer, but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.

Nesting of these structures inside assignment-blocks result in complex diagrams (cf Tausworthe 1977:100,114).

                    <text>Unfortunately there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness)—an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant.
An example that uses Euclid's algorithm appears below.

Melzak's and Lambek's primitive models[28] reduced this notion to four elements: (i) discrete, distinguishablelocations, (ii) discrete, indistinguishablecounters[29] (iii) an agent, and (iv) a list of instructions that areeffective relative to the capability of the agent.[30]

Rarely must a programmer write &quot;code&quot; with such a limited instruction set.
But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine isTuring complete with only four general types of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT.[34]

Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root.
If they don't then for the algorithm to be effective it must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root.[36]

When speed is being measured, the instruction set matters.
For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a &quot;modulus&quot; (division) instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's &quot;decrement&quot;).

Kemeny and Kurtz observe that while &quot;undisciplined&quot; use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in &quot;spaghetti code &quot; a programmer can write structured programs using these instructions; on the other hand &quot;it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language&quot;.[38]

One of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in an (unsorted) list of numbers.
The solution necessarily requires looking at every number in the list, but only once at each.
From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description English prose, as:

Nicomachus gives the example of 49 and 21: &quot;I subtract the less from the greater; 28 is left; then again I subtract from this the same 21 (for this is possible); 7 is left; I subtact this from 21, 14 is left; from which I again subtract 7 (for this is possible); 7 is left, but 7 cannot be subtracted from 7.&quot;

And to &quot;measure&quot; is to place a shorter measuring lengths successively (q times) along longer length l until the remaining portionr is less than the shorter length s.[44]
In modern words, remainder r = l − q*s, q being the quotient, or remainder r is the &quot;modulus&quot;, the integer-fractional part left over after the division.[45]

Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct areductio ad absurdum proof that the two numbers' common measure is in fact thegreatest.[46]
While Nicomachus' algorithm is the same as Euclid's, when the numbers are prime to one another it yields the number &quot;1&quot; for their common measure.
So to be precise the following is really Nicomachus' algorithm.

An elegant program for Euclid's algorithm The following version of Euclid's algorithm requires only 6 core instructions to do what 13 are required to do by &quot;Inelegant&quot;; worse, &quot;Inelegant&quot; requires moretypes of instructions.
The flowchart of &quot;Elegant&quot; can be found at the top of this article.
In the (unstructured) Basic language the steps are numbered, and the instruction LET [ ] = [ ] is the assignment instruction symbolized by ←.

This works because, when at last the minuend M is less than or equal to the subtrahend S ( Difference = Minuend − Subtrahend), the minuend can becomes (the new measuring length) and the subtrahend can become the newr (the length to be measured); in other words the &quot;sense&quot; of the subtraction reverses.

Fractional numbers?
If the input numbers, i.e. thedomain of the function computed by the algorithm/program, is to include only positive integers including zero, then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm (and the program that instantiates it) is a partial function rather than a total function .
A notable failure due to exceptions is theAriane V rocket failure.

Algorithm analysis [50] indicates why this is the case: &quot;Elegant&quot; doestwo conditional tests in every subtraction loop, whereas &quot;Inelegant&quot; only does one.
As the algorithm (usually) requires many loop-throughs,on average much time is wasted doing a &quot;B = 0?&quot; test that is needed only after the remainder is computed.

At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list.
Therefore it is said to have a space requirement ofO(1), if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(n) if it is counted.

Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa. * Logical: An algorithm may be viewed as controlled logical deduction .
This notion may be expressed as:Algorithm = logic + control.[53]

This is the basis for thelogic programming paradigm.
In pure logic programming languages the control component is fixed and algorithms are specified by supplying only the logic component.

Those computers are sometimes called serial computers.
Analgorithm designed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed toparallel algorithms or distributed algorithms .

Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together.
The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors.

Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable.
Some problems have no parallel algorithms, and are called inherently serial problems. * Deterministic or non-deterministic: Deterministic algorithms solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm whereasnon-deterministic algorithms solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through the use ofheuristics . * Exact or approximate: While many algorithms reach an exact solution, approximation algorithms seek an approximation that is close to the true solution.

                    <text>A divide and conquer algorithm repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem (usuallyrecursively ) until the instances are small enough to solve easily.
One such example of divide and conquer ismerge sorting .
Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments.

When a problem showsoptimal substructure , meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems, andoverlapping subproblems , meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach calleddynamic programming avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed.
For example,Floyd–Warshall algorithm , the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weightedgraph can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices.

                    <text>The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls.
When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems.
By using memoization or maintaining atable of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity. * The greedy method.

The greedy method extends the solution with the best possible decision (not all feasible decisions) at an algorithmic stage based on the current local optimum and the best decision (not all possible decisions) made in a previous stage.

Thus, they emulate reproduction and &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.
Ingenetic programming , this approach is extended to algorithms, by regarding the algorithm itself as a &quot;solution&quot; to a problem. [ edit ]

He defines a super-recursive class of algorithms as &quot;a class of algorithms in which it is possible to compute functions not computable by any Turing machine&quot; (Burgin 2005, p. 107).
This is closely related to the study of methods of hypercomputation .

However, practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable.
For example, inDiamond v.
Diehr , the application of a simplefeedback algorithm to aid in the curing ofsynthetic rubber was deemed patentable.
The patenting of software is highly controversial, and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms, especiallydata compression algorithms, such as Unisys ' LZW patent .

Etymology The word &quot;Algorithm&quot;, or &quot;Algorism &quot; in some other writing versions, comes from the nameal-Khwārizmī , pronounced in classical Arabic as Al-Khwarithmi.
Al-Khwārizmī (Persian : الخوارزمي‎, c.
780-850) was a Persian mathematician , astronomer , geographer and a scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad , whose name means &quot;the native of Khwarezm &quot;, a city that was part of the Greater Iran during his era and now is in modern dayUzbekistan [56]

He wrote a treatise in the Arabic language during the 9th century, which was translated intoLatin in the 12th century under the title Algoritmi de numero Indorum.
This title means &quot;Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians&quot;, where &quot;Algoritmi&quot; was the translator's Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name.[59]

Origin The word algorithm comes from the name of the 9th century Persian Muslim mathematician Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi.
The word algorism originally referred only to the rules of performing arithmetic using Hindu-Arabic numerals but evolved via European Latin translation of Al-Khwarizmi's name into algorithm by the 18th century.
The use of the word evolved to include all definite procedures for solving problems or performing tasks.[62]

Discrete and distinguishable symbols Tally-marks: To keep track of their flocks, their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying: accumulating stones or marks scratched on sticks, or making discrete symbols in clay.
Through the Babylonian and Egyptian use of marks and symbols, eventuallyRoman numerals and the abacus evolved (Dilson, p. 16–41).
Tally marks appear prominently inunary numeral system arithmetic used in Turing machine and Post–Turing machine computations.

Lovelace is credited with the first creation of an algorithm intended for processing on a computer - Babbage's analytical engine, the first device considered a realTuring-complete computer instead of just a calculator - and is sometimes called &quot;history's first programmer&quot; as a result, though a full implementation of Babbage's second device would not be realized until decades after her lifetime.

                    <text>Alan Turing 's work[86] preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing.
Turing's biographer believed that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: &quot;Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter; and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'&quot;.[87]
Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and teletypewriters we might conjecture that all were influences.

But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.[88]

                    <text>&quot;Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper.
We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book....I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e., on a tape divided into squares.
I shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may be printed is finite....
&quot;The behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his &quot;state of mind&quot; at that moment.

                    <text>&quot;'Effective method' is used here in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely determined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps.
With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date. [his footnote #5; see discussion immediately below].
The simplest of these to state (due to Post and Turing) says essentially thatan effective method of solving certain sets of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer.

                    <text>All three definitions are equivalent, so it doesn't matter which one is used.
Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one.&quot;
(Rosser 1939:225–6) Rosser's footnote #5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of λ-definability, in particular Church's use of it in hisAn Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory (1936); (2) Herbrand and Gödel and their use of recursion in particular Gödel's use in his famous paperOn Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I (1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936–7) in their mechanism-models of computation.

                    <text>In setting up a complete algorithmic theory, what we do is to describe a procedure, performable for each set of values of the independent variables, which procedure necessarily terminates and in such manner that from the outcome we can read a definite answer, &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no,&quot; to the question, &quot;is the predicate value true?&quot;&quot; (Kleene 1943:273) [edit ]
History after 1950 A number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of &quot;algorithm&quot;, and activity is on-going because of issues surrounding, in particular,foundations of mathematics (especially the Church–Turing thesis ) andphilosophy of mind (especially arguments aroundartificial intelligence ).

Rogers opines that: &quot;a computation is carried out in a discrete stepwise fashion, without use of continuous methods or analogue devices . . . carried forward deterministically, without resort to random methods or devices, e.g., dice&quot; Rogers 1987:2. * &lt;s&gt; Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:274 * &lt;s&gt; Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:225 * &lt;s&gt; Moschovakis, Yiannis N.

The holes have unlimited capacity, and standing by is an agent who understands and is able to carry out the list of instructions&quot; (Lambek 1961:295).
Lambek references Melzak who defines his Q-machine as &quot;an indefinitely large number of locations . . . an indefinitely large supply of counters distributed among these locations, a program, and an operator whose sole purpose is to carry out the program&quot; (Melzak 1961:283).

                    <text>* Correctness: does it produce the right answer? * Implementation: how do you code it? * Performance: is it fast enough?
Understanding programming You can distinguish three levels of understanding programming: * Imitative: copy some code, change it around until it works. * Operational: picture how the computer executes each statement. * Deductive: derive code from intended solution, analyze correctness and performance.
We'll work at levels 2 and 3.

                    <text>Programming in general These lessons apply to any programming language. * The distinction between a problem (requirements or specification) and a particular method for solving that problem (algorithm).
There can be different algorithms that solve the same problem. * The distinction between an algorithm and its realization in one particular programming language. * Working from specifications and designs expressed in natural language, pseudocode, or diagrams. * Different algorithms (that solve the same problem) can have wildly different performances. * Analysis of performance (using counting).
The role of analysis versus experiment (testing). * Quantification of performance: Big-O notation, the function concept, sums, powers, logs, growth of functions. * Analysis of correctness (using assertions).

                    <text>- Paging is solution to external fragmentation problem which is to permit the logical address space of a process to be noncontiguous, thus allowing a process to be allocating physical memory wherever the latter is available. * While running DOS on a PC, which command would be used to duplicate the entire diskette?
diskcopy * What resources are used when a thread created?
How do they differ from those when a process is created? - When a thread is created the threads does not require any new resources to execute the thread shares the resources like memory of the process to which they belong to.

                    <text>The benefit of code sharing is that it allows an application to have several different threads of activity all within the same address space.
Whereas if a new process creation is very heavyweight because it always requires new address space to be created and even if they share the memory then the inter process communication is expensive when compared to the communication between the threads. * What is virtual memory? - Virtual memory is hardware technique where the system appears to have more memory that it actually does.

                    <text>The concept of multiprogramming is that the operating system keeps several jobs in memory simultaneously.
The operating system selects a job from the job pool and starts executing a job, when that job needs to wait for any i/o operations the CPU is switched to another job.

All other scheduling is preemptive. * What is Context Switch? - Switching the CPU to another process requires saving the state of the old process and loading the saved state for the new process.
This task is known as a context switch.
Context-switch time is pure overhead, because the system does no useful work while switching.

                    <text>The two types differ in the technology they use to hold data, dynamic RAM being the more common type.
Dynamic RAM needs to be refreshed thousands of times per second.
Static RAM does not need to be refreshed, which makes it faster; but it is also more expensive than dynamic RAM.
Both types of RAM are volatile, meaning that they lose their contents when the power is turned off.

For example, a computer with 8M RAM has approximately 8 million bytes of memory that programs can use.
In contrast, ROM (read-only memory) refers to special memory used to store programs that boot the computer and perform diagnostics.

                    <text>It is a useful, memory-saving technique for multiprogrammed timesharing systems.
A Reentrant Procedure is one in which multiple users can share a single copy of a program during the same period.
Reentrancy has 2 key aspects: The program code cannot modify itself, and the local data for each user process must be stored separately.
Thus, the permanent part is the code, and the temporary part is the pointer back to the calling program and local variables used by that program.

                    <text>Each execution instance is called activation.
It executes the code in the permanent part, but has its own copy of local variables/parameters.
The temporary part associated with each activation is the activation record.
Generally, the activation record is kept on the stack.
Note: A reentrant procedure can be interrupted and called by an interrupting program, and still execute correctly on returning to the procedure.

                    <text>Also called FIFO anomaly.
Usually, on increasing the number of frames allocated to a process virtual memory, the process execution is faster, because fewer page faults occur.
Sometimes, the reverse happens, i.e., the execution time increases even when more frames are allocated to the process.
This is Belady's Anomaly.
This is true for certain page reference patterns.

This relates to processes that are in a blocked or suspended state.
They are swapped out of real-memory until they are ready to execute.
The swapping-in decision is based on memory-management criteria.

                    <text>The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor (also called aCPU), handles information.
The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system.

                    <text>To install a 64-bit version of Windows Vista, you need a processor that's capable of running a 64-bit version ofWindows.
The benefits of using a 64-bit operating system are most apparent when you have a large amount of random access memory (RAM) installed on your computer (typically 4 GB of RAM or more).
In such cases, because a 64-bit operating system can handle large amounts of memory more efficiently than a 32-bit operating system, a 64-bit operating system can be more responsive when running several programs at the same time and switching between them frequently.

                    <text>However, since you're already getting a fresh start on the Mac, you may want to consider purchasing 1Password from the Mac App Store.
While unfortunately I'm unable to offer a discount for app store purchases, there are several benefits to this:

                    <text>* Installation and updates are easily managed through the App Store interface. * You can install 1Password on multiple Macs using the same Apple ID. * App Store purchasers will automatically get a free upgrade to 1Password 4 when it is released in the future, bringing down your long-term cost.
Sorry to leave you with more questions than answers, but I want to be sure you're completely aware of your options, so you can make the best choice for your situation.

Although there are ways to prevent these pop-ups, they are, for the most part, not annoying or offensive.
There are other kinds of pop-ups that occur regardless of what site you are visiting, and can pop-up even when you are not even surfing the internet!

                    <text>These kinds of pop-ups are a result of your computer being &quot;infected&quot; with a type of program know as spyware.
Spyware is a category of program that tracks your activities on your computer, and then responds to your activities by opening up internet browsers to pages that may sell products that your surfing activities indicate you may be interested in.
They call this a service.

Since you would not continually execute this software, it must get executed on startup to be so annoying.

Often you will not know what the program that is causing your problems is called, so only remove those programs that you know are unnecessary (anything with the words &quot;Buddy&quot;, or &quot;Ad&quot; are good bets).

                    <text>Other spyware programs cannot be removed by simply looking in the Add/Remove Control Panel.
Since we know that these programs must be run on startup, you can take care of this problem by looking through the startup tab of the msconfig utility.
Anything that is being run out of your profile directory, or temporary internet directory should be immediately unchecked.
Remember, very little actually needs to be run on startup -- look at the MS Config section of this site for more information on this.

                    <text>DLL Error In computers, a dynamic link library (DLL) is a collection of small programs, any of which can be called when needed by a larger program that is running in the computer.
The small program that lets the larger program communicate with a specific device such as a printer or scanner is often packaged as a DLL program (usually referred to as a DLL file).
DLL files that support specific device operation are known as device drivers.

                    <text>The advantage of DLL files is that, because they don't get loaded into random access memory (RAM) together with the main program, space is saved in RAM.
When and if a DLL file is needed, then it is loaded and run.
For example, as long as a user of Microsoft Word is editing a document, the printer DLL file does not need to be loaded into RAM.
If the user decides to print the document, then the Word application causes the printer DLL file to be loaded and run.

                    <text>Whenever you install a program it will, without doubt, install DLL files; programs will also update DLL files which are currently being used by other programs with their own custom version.
These custom versions may not be compatible with other programs that use this file; because of this it is incredible that Windows machines run nearly as well as they do.

Visit your software company's web site and browse until you reach the product update section.
Download and follow the page's installation instructions in order to correctly patch your software.
Even if the company does not have a fix for the problem, they may have a documented work-around in order to resolve the problem.

                    <text>The form of the question is designed to mimic what the moderator of a technical interviewer would be asking and the answers are straightforward, giving enough detail to appear knowledgeable without reaching the point of overachieving.
The 200 questions in operating systems cover the full spectrum of an operating systems course; most of them could be the starting point for an excellent exam question.

                    <text>The second section of the book is a set of 51 questions that fit into the category of interview questions that an interviewee in any field could receive.
For example, question 26 is &quot;Tell me about a time when you successfully persuaded a group to accept your proposal.&quot;
Glancing through them would be an excellent way to start your preparatory process for the interview.
There is one flaw in the book and that is the many errors in Basic English.

Vista upgrade hangs at 62% Windows 7 can start causing problems before it's even installed, as many people report their upgrade hangs forever at 62%.

                    <text>Reboot, and your PC should roll back to Windows Vista.
You can then open the setup log file \$WINDOWS.
BT\Sources\Panther\setupact.log to view what happened.
Microsoft say this is usually caused because the Iphlpsvc service has stopped responding, and just adding an environment variable to ignore it will fix the problem.
Point your browser at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/975253 for the fix.

And you might also try to boot and install from the Windows 7 disc, if possible, as that reduces the chance of any conflict with your existing Vista (or XP) setup.

Resetting the drive letter has worked for some.
Click Start, type Disk Management and choose the &quot;Create and format hard disk partitions&quot; link.
If your optical drive is visible here then right-click it, select Change Drive Letter and Paths, click Change and choose a new letter.
If the drive is now visible in Explorer, then repeat the process to change the drive letter back; if it's still not visible, reboot and it should appear.

Click Start, type Aero, choose the &quot;Find and fix problems with transparency and other visual effects&quot; link, and click Next to launch the Aero troubleshooting wizard.
It'll try to identify and resolve and problems.
And if it doesn't, then install the latest driver for your graphics hardware.
That could be all your system needs.

For example, if Aero Peek (the ability to make open windows transparent to display your desktop underneath) doesn't work for you, then launch REGEDIT, browse to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM and make sure EnableAeroPeek is set to 1, rather than 0.

Aero Snap irritations Windows 7's new ability to move and resize windows, all in one movement, can be a genuine productivity boost.
But if you find windows moving around when you don't expect it then Aero Snap is more of an annoyance than anything else, though at least it's one you can disable in just a few seconds.

Particularly 64-bit Windows 7 systems, based around the P55 chipset.
The iPhone is usually (though not always) recognised, but iTunes then complains that it can't connect to the unit because of an &quot;unknown error&quot;, usually (though again, not always) 0xE8000065.

Windows 7 themes change your custom icons Windows 7 has some spectacular new themes - there's a great selection at the Microsoft site - but installing them can have one annoying side-effect.
If you've previously changed a system icon like Computer or the Recycle Bin then that could disappear, replaced by the equivalent icon from the theme pack.

                    <text>* There are arguments both for and against running heterogeneous networks, but the deciding factor will mostly likely be your budget.
With unlimited resources, it would of course make sense to use the &quot;best of breed&quot; hardware and software for each service that you run on your network.

                    <text>For your Web site, for example, you might decide to use anApache Web server that runs on aLinux box, while your users authenticate and access the network via a Microsoft 2003 domain server.
Using the most suitable software for each service makes the overall system more robust and reliable.
Many application services are designed as multi-tier systems spanning database servers, application servers, Web servers and clients.

                    <text>It is common for different tiers of these services to execute on servers that use different operating systems.
If you use application-oriented clusters to host such applications, you can still achieve a unified view of the total application service, while making it more effective and less prone to error.
The main problem with this type of configuration, though, is that it introduces a serious amount of additional administrative overhead.

                    <text>Taking the example of a Linux Web server and a Windows domain, your IT department would need the skills to configure, maintain and support both Linux and Microsoft systems.
You would need an increased staff in order to achieve this, obviously adding to your overall IT costs.
Running a heterogeneous system will also increase the overall complexity of your network, which in turn increases the risk of errors or inadvertentdata security breaches caused by the diverse systems and components.

Not all software programs will be available in every OS version, so you may have to run completely different antispyware programs, for example, with each operating system.

                    <text>This further increases your administrative overhead.
You mention using a different platform for development than for other infrastructure operations.
Your development environment should certainly be kept separate from your day-to-day network operations, but by developing applications on a different platform altogether, you could end up with increased development costs and deployment issues.

Why have these predictions not panned out?
It seems to me, that from Tanenbaum's perspective, they're pretty reasonable predictions of the future.
What happened so that they didn't come to pass?

He was, maybe, naïve if he really stated a strong belief it would happen that fast (or happen at all), partly because of social inertia and monopolies, and partly because efficient microkernels aren't that easy to implement in general-purpose systems.
(so yeah, luck) – njsg Mar 22 '12 at 11:01 13   Tanenbaum is not totally wrong: in the new post PC era, iOS is based on Mach and ARM, Android is based on L4 and ARM.

It's a bit of a stretch when you look at some textbook microkernels, but the claims had some technical justification.

Intel engineers did some amazing work to squeeze life out of their instruction set, even to the point of making a RISC core with an opcode translator that sits on top.
Compare to one of the dominant RISC desktop chip makers, IBM, who could not get a power-efficient and high performanceG5 for Apple laptops in a reasonable timeframe.

If a google server farm runs linux (does it?) and each box counts toward the linux count, and my cable modem running a stripped down version of linux counts, and my android phone counts, then linux probably dominates.

RISC CPUs could get that too but at this point you're not comparing RISC vs.

The total chips in use and sales was from an academic presentation. –  ccoakley Mar 22 '12 at 9:23 5   @KonradRudolph recreating citation for total sales via google: 3 billion ARM chips shipped in 2009 ( vanshardware.com/2010/08/mirror-the-coming-war-arm-versus-x86 ) while an estimated 400 million x86 chips sold in 2011 (4 times quarterly number reported here:computerworlduk.com/news/it-business/3345299/… ).

                    <text>The biggest thing that was overlooked in this debate was the impact of CPU manufacturing technology and economics, driven by shrinking transistor sizes as expressed in Moore's Law (not surprising as though they knew a lot about CPU hardware, these guys studied and debated software, not CPU manufacturing or economics).
Fixed manufacturing costs which are amortized over CPU's (e.g.
ISA design, CPU design and CPU production facilities) have grown rapidly, thereby increasing the value of economies of scale; with per unit CPU costs (in terms of &quot;bang for the buck&quot; &amp; &quot;bang for the watt&quot;) plummeting, the cost of a CPU needn't be amortized over such a broad selection of functions to provide value, so computing in products with fixed function has exploded; CPU transistor budgets have grown exponentially, therefore wasting a fixed number of transistors due inefficiencies in ISA design is of no consequence.

                    <text>1. CPU Scale Wins Over CPU Diversity The importance of economies of scale has made the benefits of a ISA/CPU targeting a larger (therefore broader) market outweighs the potential benefits from design choices which narrow the market for an ISA/CPU.
OS's can address larger and larger portions of the market per supported ISA/CPU, so there is little need (or even no need) for porting exercises to allow an OS ecosystem to thrive.
The problem domains ISA's &amp; CPU's target tend to be so broad that they mostly overlap, so for any software beyond a compiler, the size of porting exercises has also diminished.

As Tanenbaum described, modern OS kernels do abstract out the distinctions between CPU's &amp; ISA's.

                    <text>However, the CPU/ISA specific code in modern OS's is much smaller than a microkernel.
Rather than implementing interrupt handling/scheduling, memory management, communication &amp; I/O, these non-portable bits address only a tiny fraction of the implementation of those services, with the vast majority of the architecture of even these core OS functions being portable.

                    <text>2. Open Source Won the Battle, But Lost the War More bang for the buck means that a larger share of computing is performed by fixed function products, where the ability to modify the product is not part of the value proposition for the customer.
Now ironically, open source has flourished in these fixed function devices, but more often than not, the benefits of those freedoms being realized more by those making the products rather than end users (which actually was true of the software market even back then: Microsoft was a big consumer of open source software, but their customers were not).

                    <text>Similarly, one could argue that open source has struggled more in the general purpose desktop space than anywhere else, but as the web and cloud computing has grown, desktop computing has increasingly been used for a narrower purpose (primarily running a browser), with the remaining functions running in the cloud (ironically, primarily on open source platforms).
In short: open source does really own the general purpose computing space, but the market has become more sophisticated; computing product packaging less often stops at general purpose function, but continues along to product intended for fixed functions, where much of the advantage of open source computing is in conflict with the product goals.

                    <text>3. 2n Growth Means Fixed k Savings Are Not Important The exponential growth of transistor budgets has brought with it the realization that the transistor budget cost of a CISC architecture is almost completely fixed.
RISC's strategic advantage was that it moved complexity out of the CPU's instruction set and in to the compiler (no doubt partly motivated by the fact that compiler writers benefited far less from complex ISA's than human developers coding in assembly, but compilers could much more easily reason mathematically about, and therefore exploit, a simpler ISA); the resulting transistor savings could then be applied to improving CPU performance.
The caveat was that the transistor budget savings from a simpler ISA was mostly fixed (and overhead in compiler design was mostly fixed too).

                    <text>While this fixed impact was a huge chunk of the budget back in the day, as one can imagine it only takes a few rounds of exponential growth for the impact to become trivial.
This rapidly declining impact combined with the afore mentioned rapidly increasing importance of the CPU monoculture meant a very small window of opportunity for any new ISA to establish itself.
Even where new ISA's did succeed, modern &quot;RISC&quot; ISA's are are not the orthogonal ISA's described by the RISC strategy, as continued growth in transistor budgets and broader applicability of SIMD processing in particular has encouraged the adoption of new instructions tuned for specific functions.

                    <text>The modern Linux kernel (along with most other kernels) fits the rather loose definition of a macrokernel and not the rather than the narrow definition of a microkernel.
That said, with its driver architecture, dynamically loaded modules and multiprocessing optimizations which make kernel space communications increasingly resemble a microkernel's message passing, it's structure more closely resembles a microkernel design (as embodied by Minix) than the macrokernel design (as embodied by Linux's design at the time of the discussion).
Like a microkernel design, the Linux kernel does provide generalized communication, scheduling, interrupt handling, and memory management for all other OS components; its components do tend to have distinct code and data structures.

In the end, Moore's Law ensured that issues motivated by hardware concerns like portability (a concern of Tanenbaum's) &amp; performance (a concern of Torvalds') diminished, but software development issues became of paramount importance.
The remaining unrealized advantages that a separation of address spaces could provide are outweighed by the additional baggage imposed on the OS software due to design limitations and increased complexity of component interfaces.

                    <text>Interestingly, what has been a strong trend is the emergence of the hypervisor, which much like microkernels, abstracts out the hardware.
Some claim that hypervisors are microkernels.
Hypervisor architecture is different though, as responsibilities meant to be owned by microkernels are handled by the &quot;guest&quot; kernels sitting atop, with hypervisors multiplex between them, and the hypervisor abstraction is not generic messaging and memory address space, but predominantly actual hardware emulation.

It's hard to make precise definitions about the future because there are so many factors outside of the argument that can come in to play; looser semantics means your predictions are a larger target on the dartboard than the other guy's, giving you way better odds.
If you ignore semantics, the arguments advanced by both Torvalds and Tanenbaum were right about a lot of things and wrong about very little.

If you want to claim your predictions proved right, leave yourself as much semantic maneuvering room as possible, just like Mr. Torvalds.

People have argued for years about whether microkernels (nanokernels, picokernels, etc.) are technically superior, but for the moment, let's just assume they are.
We're still left with a question of whether that technical superiority is likely to translate to market dominance.

What they haven't mentioned is the ubiquity of what I'd call &quot;microkernel 2.0&quot;.

They really are pretty much microkernels though.

                    <text>The big difference is that Tanenbaum thought in terms of a microkernel and a user-mode OS emulation both designed specifically for each other.
Instead, we've kept the OS essentially unchanged, and tailored the microkernel to run it as-is.
This isn't as nice technically, but from a market perspective, it's dramatically superior -- instead of a whole new system top to bottom, the user can continue to use most of his existing code as-is, and just add a cool new &quot;utility&quot; that happens to really be a microkernel OS.

Consumers particularly loved the GUI interfaces as opposed to the old text based systems of Unix and DOS.
This meant more average people would purchase computers for home use.
Also, the explosion of the Internet in the mid-90's increased sales.

So the existence of a stripped-down version of linux that is smaller in size than minix isn't really relevant. – Robz Mar 22 '12 at 0:31 @Robz Size is kind of relevant - the point of a microkernel is to give you portability, and enable certain edge cases (like running two OS environments on one machine at once without virtualisation).
If the microkernel is bigger than a hybrid/monolith that limits the platforms it can be deployed on, AND it tends to destroy the argument that it is easier to achieve portability by writing a small component if it is not in fact smaller than the alternative. – Marcin Mar 22 '12 at 11:11 up vote 5 down vote Ultimately it all comes down to the fact that things don't really like to change.

Linux took too long to replace Unix, and still doesn't quite have enough of a compelling solution to running on the desktop (partly because of ideological problems with different Window systems, binary graphics drivers, and the lack of a stable ABI).
It's doing rather well in other non-desktop markets like embedded and mobile however.

Unfortunately, MIPS and SPARC never scaled up very well, and DEC ran out of money before the Alpha got enough market share to matter.
Intel was able to crank quite a bit of performance out of x86, so there really wasn't a compelling reason to change (for most people).

                    <text>Nowadays it's very cheap to decode CISC instructions into micro-ops and it's very expensive to access the RAM.
So CISC has the advantage of pushing more code in the L1/L2/L3 caches share |improve this answer answered Mar 24 '12 at 10:34 community wiki Christian up vote 1 down vote Microkernels are the future x86 will die out and RISC architectures will dominate the market (5 years from then) everyone will be running a free GNU OS It depends how you view and define future, in the traditional sense his predictions have failed.

My question is about how the world is now and why it hasn't already reflected his predictions. – Robz Mar 21 '12 at 23:28 Those reasons have all ready been listed by others, I'm giving you an alternative view, as part of any healthy discussion all perspectives should be at least considered.

Nobody uses the GNU Hurd kernel, and if you remove all GNU userspace tools from Linux or OS X desktops, most people wouldn't even notice.

                    <text>Microkernels failed For the reasons that Linus Torvalds stated, that on paper it looks theoretically attractive but in implementation on modern systems - which are very complex systems - the complexity becomes exponentially unmanageable.
Case study is GNU Hurd, a fully microkernel system which failed to even achieve basic functions.
Mac OS X is similar to Hurd in structure and it's the least stable and most constrained OS out there.

Most Linux deployments on the desktop are sometimes recorded as Windows deployments because users buy a Windows system and then write over it with Linux.
However, if you segment OS's then Linux has around 5-6% on the desktop according tohttp://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_os.asp and this is equal to the number of Windows Vista users worldwide which is highly significant.

If you think that only 45% approx users use Windows 7 that means that the adoption of new Windows OS's each Windows upgrade cycle decreases a little by 10-15% and users either stay with the old version or go to Mac or Linux.

Dunno about microkernals, but 2) The idea of RISC had two legs: that software optimizations could be done in software better than in the hardware, and that RISC chips could economically be made that were faster than CISC chips.

Intel could, and did, make CISC chips that clocked instructions faster than the competing RISC chips, at a competitive price.
Intel could, and did, make CISC chips that did program optimization better in hardware than could be done in the compiler, or in the software runtime supervisor --and any software optimization could be added on top of that, just as it would with a RISC chip.

                <section>
                    <text>It is a useful, memory-saving technique for multiprogrammed timesharing systems.
A Reentrant Procedure is one in which multiple users can share a single copy of a program during the same period.
Reentrancy has 2 key aspects: The program code cannot modify itself, and the local data for each user process must be stored separately.
Thus, the permanent part is the code, and the temporary part is the pointer back to the calling program and local variables used by that program.

                    <text>Each execution instance is called activation.
It executes the code in the permanent part, but has its own copy of local variables/parameters.
The temporary part associated with each activation is the activation record.
Generally, the activation record is kept on the stack.
Note: A reentrant procedure can be interrupted and called by an interrupting program, and still execute correctly on returning to the procedure.

                    <text>Also called FIFO anomaly.
Usually, on increasing the number of frames allocated to a process virtual memory, the process execution is faster, because fewer page faults occur.
Sometimes, the reverse happens, i.e., the execution time increases even when more frames are allocated to the process.
This is Belady's Anomaly.
This is true for certain page reference patterns.

This is due to an inordinate number of page faults.

                    <text>Medium term scheduling is part of the swapping function.
This relates to processes that are in a blocked or suspended state.
They are swapped out of real-memory until they are ready to execute.
The swapping-in decision is based on memory-management criteria.

This scheduler is invoked whenever an event occurs.
It may lead to interruption of one process by preemption.

                    <text>The form of the question is designed to mimic what the moderator of a technical interviewer would be asking and the answers are straightforward, giving enough detail to appear knowledgeable without reaching the point of overachieving.
The 200 questions in operating systems cover the full spectrum of an operating systems course; most of them could be the starting point for an excellent exam question.

                    <text>The second section of the book is a set of 51 questions that fit into the category of interview questions that an interviewee in any field could receive.
For example, question 26 is &quot;Tell me about a time when you successfully persuaded a group to accept your proposal.&quot;
Glancing through them would be an excellent way to start your preparatory process for the interview.
There is one flaw in the book and that is the many errors in Basic English.

                    <text>- Paging is solution to external fragmentation problem which is to permit the logical address space of a process to be noncontiguous, thus allowing a process to be allocating physical memory wherever the latter is available. * While running DOS on a PC, which command would be used to duplicate the entire diskette?
diskcopy * What resources are used when a thread created?
How do they differ from those when a process is created? - When a thread is created the threads does not require any new resources to execute the thread shares the resources like memory of the process to which they belong to.

                    <text>The benefit of code sharing is that it allows an application to have several different threads of activity all within the same address space.
Whereas if a new process creation is very heavyweight because it always requires new address space to be created and even if they share the memory then the inter process communication is expensive when compared to the communication between the threads. * What is virtual memory? - Virtual memory is hardware technique where the system appears to have more memory that it actually does.

                    <text>As in hard real time systems kernel delays need to be bounded * What is the cause of thrashing?
How does the system detect thrashing?
Once it detects thrashing, what can the system do to eliminate this problem? - Thrashing is caused by under allocation of the minimum number of pages required by a process, forcing it to continuously page fault.

                    <text>The system can detect thrashing by evaluating the level of CPU utilization as compared to the level of multiprogramming.
It can be eliminated by reducing the level of multiprogramming. * What is multi tasking, multi programming, multi threading? - Multi programming: Multiprogramming is the technique of running several programs at a time using timesharing.
It allows a computer to do several things at the same time.
Multiprogramming creates logical parallelism.

                    <text>The concept of multiprogramming is that the operating system keeps several jobs in memory simultaneously.
The operating system selects a job from the job pool and starts executing a job, when that job needs to wait for any i/o operations the CPU is switched to another job.

                    <text>So the main idea here is that the CPU is never idle.
Multi tasking: Multitasking is the logical extension of multiprogramming .The concept of multitasking is quite similar to multiprogramming but difference is that the switching between jobs occurs so frequently that the users can interact with each program while it is running.
This concept is also known as time-sharing systems.

                    <text>The amount of time that a client might have to wait for its request to be serviced could be enormous.
So it is efficient to have one process that contains multiple threads to serve the same purpose.

                    <text>This approach would multithread the web-server process, the server would create a separate thread that would listen for client requests when a request was made rather than creating another process it would create another thread to service the request.
To get the advantages like responsiveness, Resource sharing economy and utilization of multiprocessor architectures multithreading concept can be used. * What is hard disk and what is its purpose?
- Hard disk is the secondary storage device, which holds the data in bulk, and it holds the data on the magnetic medium of the disk.Hard disks have a hard platter that holds the magnetic medium, the magnetic medium can be easily erased and rewritten, and a typical desktop machine will have a hard disk with a capacity of between 10 and 40 gigabytes.

                    <text>Data is stored onto the disk in the form of files. * What is fragmentation?
Different types of fragmentation? - Fragmentation occurs in a dynamic memory allocation system when many of the free blocks are too small to satisfy any request.External Fragmentation: External Fragmentation happens when a dynamic memory allocation algorithm allocates some memory and a small piece is left over that cannot be effectively used.

                    <text>If too much external fragmentation occurs, the amount of usable memory is drastically reduced.
Total memory space exists to satisfy a request, but it is not contiguous.Internal Fragmentation: Internal fragmentation is the space wasted inside of allocated memory blocks because of restriction on the allowed sizes of allocated blocks.

                    <text>DRAM data resides in a cell made of a capacitor and a transistor.
The capacitor tends to lose data unless it’s recharged every couple of milliseconds, and this recharging tends to slow down the performance of DRAM compared to speedier RAM types. * What is Dispatcher?
- Dispatcher module gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler; this involves: Switching context, Switching to user mode, Jumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that program, dispatch latency Ã¢â‚¬â€œ time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another running. * What is CPU Scheduler?

                    <text>- Selects from among the processes in memory that are ready to execute, and allocates the CPU to one of them.
CPU scheduling decisions may take place when a process: 1.Switches from running to waiting state.
2.Switches from running to ready state.
3.Switches from waiting to ready.

                    <text>4.Terminates.
Scheduling under 1 and 4 is non-preemptive.
All other scheduling is preemptive. * What is Context Switch? - Switching the CPU to another process requires saving the state of the old process and loading the saved state for the new process.
This task is known as a context switch.
Context-switch time is pure overhead, because the system does no useful work while switching.

                    <text>Its speed varies from machine to machine, depending on the memory speed, the number of registers which must be copied, the existed of special instructions(such as a single instruction to load or store all registers). * What is cache memory? - Cache memory is random access memory (RAM) that a computer microprocessor can access more quickly than it can access regular RAM.
As the microprocessor processes data, it looks first in the cache memory and if it finds the data there (from a previous reading of data), it does not have to do the more time-consuming reading of data from larger memory. * What is a Safe State and what is its use in deadlock avoidance?

                    <text>- When a process requests an available resource, system must decide if immediate allocation leaves the system in a safe state.
System is in safe state if there exists a safe sequence of all processes.
Deadlock Avoidance: ensure that a system will never enter an unsafe state. * What is a Real-Time System? - A real time process is a process that must respond to the events within a certain time period.

But there are a lot of tricky questions ,answer to those question are very difficult. so my request is if you could add more questions(tricky) and corresponding answers. yours sincerely * honey Posted 5/25/2006 at 10:14 pm | Permalink Last modified: Tuesday, February 24, 2004 Pronounced ramm, acronym for random access memory, a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly; that is, any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes.
RAM is the most common type of memory found in computers and other devices, such as printers.

                    <text>The two types differ in the technology they use to hold data, dynamic RAM being the more common type.
Dynamic RAM needs to be refreshed thousands of times per second.
Static RAM does not need to be refreshed, which makes it faster; but it is also more expensive than dynamic RAM.
Both types of RAM are volatile, meaning that they lose their contents when the power is turned off.

                    <text>In common usage, the term RAM is synonymous with main memory, the memory available to programs.
For example, a computer with 8M RAM has approximately 8 million bytes of memory that programs can use.
In contrast, ROM (read-only memory) refers to special memory used to store programs that boot the computer and perform diagnostics.

                    <text>Most personal computers have a small amount of ROM (a few thousand bytes).
In fact, both types of memory (ROM and RAM) allow random access.
To be precise, therefore, RAM should be referred to as read/write RAM and ROM as read-only RAM.

                    <text>When a thread is created the threads does not require any new resources to execute the thread shares the resources like memory of the process to which they belong to.
The benefit of code sharing is that it allows an application to have several different threads of activity all within the same address space.
Whereas if a new process creation is very heavyweight because it always requires new address space to be created and even if they share the memory then the inter process communication is expensive when compared to the communication between the threads.

                    <text>What is Throughput, Turnaround time, waiting time and Response time?
Throughput – number of processes that complete their execution per time unit.
Turnaround time – amount of time to execute a particular process.
Waiting time – amount of time a process has been waiting in the ready queue.
Response time – amount of time it takes from when a request was submitted until the first response is produced, not output (for time-sharing environment).

                    <text>Real-Time systems may be either hard or soft real-time.
Hard real-time: Secondary storage limited or absent, data stored in short term memory, or read-only memory (ROM), Conflicts with time-sharing systems, not supported by general-purpose operating systems.
Soft real-time: Limited utility in industrial control of robotics, Useful in applications (multimedia, virtual reality) requiring advanced operating-system features.

                    <text>Ans: - Mutex is a program object that allows multiple program threads to share the same resource, such as file access, but not simultaneously.
When a program is started a mutex is created woth a unique name.
After this stage, any thread that needs the resource must lock the mutex from other threads while it is using the resource. the mutex is set to unlock when the data is no longer needed or the routine is finished.

                    <text>A processor executes threads, not processes, so each application has at least one process, and a process always has at least one thread of execution, known as the primary thread.
A process can have multiple threads in addition to the primary thread.
Prior to the introduction of multiple threads of execution, applications were all designed to run on a single thread of execution.

                    <text>When a thread begins to execute, it continues until it is killed or until it is interrupted by a thread with higher priority (by a user action or the kernel’s thread scheduler).
Each thread can run separate sections of code, or multiple threads can execute the same section of code.
Threads executing the same block of code maintain separate stacks.
Each thread in a process shares that process’s global variables and resources.

                    <text>Answer: Convenient programming is the way of programming using the available resources like Library APIs, Macros etc without caring for efficiency.
Let me explain this with an example.
Suppose we need to convert a character into an upper case, only if the character is an alphabet in lower case.

                    <text>A convinient way of achieving this is as follows if( isalpha(ch) ) { ch = toupper(ch); } However, the overhead with this is as follows 1.
Involves the use of ctype.h library and 2.
Takes high MIPS (million instructions per second) since it involves function calls.

If change the sceduling of one process from A to B then the others task have no effect in linux but in VxWorks all task’s scheduling change to B, i.e. in VxWorks all the task have same scheduling but in linux it can different.
In Vxworks you can access any memory location(should be exist), but in linux you can access only the segment which have allocated for that process.

The process of gathering data and transforming it into a standard format before it is transmitted over a network so that the data can transcend network boundaries.
In order for an object to be moved around a network, it must be converted into a data stream that corresponds with the packet structure of the network transfer protocol.

So once a thread locks it, then other threads/processes will either spin or block on the mutex.
Whereas, semaphore allows one or more threads/processes to share the resource.

Ans:- A mutex object is a synchronization object whose state is set to signaled when it is not owned by any thread, and non-signaled when it is owned.
For example, to prevent two threads from writing to shared memory at the same time, each thread waits for ownership of a mutex object before executing the code that accesses the memory.
After writing to the shared memory, the thread releases the mutex object.

                    <text>Ans:- A semaphore object is a synchronization object that maintains a count between zero and a specified maximum value.
The count is decremented each time a thread completes a wait for the semaphore object and incremented each time a thread releases the semaphore.
When the count reaches zero, no more threads can successfully wait for the semaphore object state to become signaled.

                    <text>The state of a semaphore is set to signaled when its count is greater than zero, and non-signaled when its count is zero.
The semaphore object is useful in controlling a shared resource that can support a limited number of users.
It acts as a gate that limits the number of threads sharing the resource to a specified maximum number.

Ans: A binary Semaphore and mutex are one and the same.A binary semaphore has different types like counting semaphore,binary semaphore.Let me put in this way a mutex is a semaphore with count as 1 that means synchronization is achived to process/thread for the resource in one by one manner * Krishna Pradeep Posted 6/26/2007 at 12:37 pm | Permalink The difference between an ordinary binary semaphore and a mutex semaphore is in the way the semaphore is initialized.

                    <text>For an ordinary binary semaphore, a task attempting to synchronize to an external event creates an empty semaphore.
When it reaches the point to be synchronized, it attempts to take a semaphore.
If unavailable, it waits at this point.

                    <text>For a mutex semaphore, a task wishing to block other tasks from a resouce first creates a full semaphore, and then takes the semaphore, making it unavailable to other tasks.
When it is no longer needed, it the task gives the semaphore, making the resource available.
A mutual exclusion semaphore must have matching “takes&quot; and “gives&quot;.

When a mutex is locked by a thread, the same thread has to release it; it cannot be released by other thread.
When a binary semaphore is locked, the other thread can release it and then lock it again.

This means that the semaphore can be taken more than once by the task that holds it before finally being released.

                    <text>Semaphores exist in many variants, though usually the term refers to a counting semaphore, since a binary semaphore is better known as a mutex.
A counting semaphore is a counter for a set of available resources, rather than a locked/unlocked flag of a single resource.
It was invented by Edsger Dijkstra.
Semaphores are the classic solution to preventing race conditions in the dining philosophers problem, although they do not prevent resource deadlocks.

                    <text>The benefit of code sharing is that it allows an application to have several different threads of activity all within the same address space.
Whereas if a new process creation is very heavyweight because it always requires new address space to be created and even if they share the memory then the inter process communication is expensive when compared to the communication between the threads.

As the microprocessor processes data, it looks first in the cache memory and if it finds the data there (from a previous reading of data), it does not have to do the more time-consuming reading of data from larger memory.

                    <text>Context-switch time is pure overhead, because the system does no useful work while switching.
Its speed varies from machine to machine, depending on the memory speed, the number of registers which must be copied, the existed of special instructions(such as a single instruction to load or store all registers).

DRAM data resides in a cell made of a capacitor and a transistor.
The capacitor tends to lose data unless it’s recharged every couple of milliseconds, and this recharging tends to slow down the performance of DRAM compared to speedier RAM types.

External Fragmentation: External Fragmentation happens when a dynamic memory allocation algorithm allocates some memory and a small piece is left over that cannot be effectively used.
If too much external fragmentation occurs, the amount of usable memory is drastically reduced.

Internal Fragmentation: Internal fragmentation is the space wasted inside of allocated memory blocks because of restriction on the allowed sizes of allocated blocks.
Allocated memory may be slightly larger than requested memory; this size difference is memory internal to a partition, but not being used → Leave a comment Posted in Operating System Interview Questions What is hard disk and what is its purpose?

It allows a computer to do several things at the same time.
Multiprogramming creates logical parallelism.
The concept of multiprogramming is that the operating system keeps several jobs in memory simultaneously.

Multi threading: An application typically is implemented as a separate process with several threads of control.
In some situations a single application may be required to perform several similar tasks for example a web server accepts client requests for web pages, images, sound, and so forth.
A busy web server may have several of clients concurrently accessing it.

                    <text>So it is efficient to have one process that contains multiple threads to serve the same purpose.
This approach would multithread the web-server process, the server would create a separate thread that would listen for client requests when a request was made rather than creating another process it would create another thread to service the request.
To get the advantages like responsiveness, Resource sharing economy and utilization of multiprocessor architectures multithreading concept can be used.

The system can detect thrashing by evaluating the level of CPU utilization as compared to the level of multiprogramming.
It can be eliminated by reducing the level of multiprogramming.

Turnaround time – amount of time to execute a particular process.
Waiting time – amount of time a process has been waiting in the ready queue.
Response time – amount of time it takes from when a request was submitted until the first response is produced, not output (for time-sharing environment).

                    <text>ANS: Mutex is a program object that allows multiple program threads to share the same resource, such as file access, but not simultaneously.
When a program is started a mutex is created with a unique name.
After this stage, any thread that needs the resource must lock the mutex from other threads while it is using the resource. the mutex is set to unlock when the data is no longer needed or the routine is finished.

                    <text>What is the difference between a ‘thread’ and a ‘process’?
ANS: A single process can have multiple threads that share global data and address space with other threads running in the same process, and therefore can operate on the same data set easily.
Processes do not share address space and a different mechanism must be used if they are to share data.

The computations may be executing on multiple cores in the same chip, preemptively time-shared threads on the same processor, or executed on physically separated processors.
A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including Petri nets, process calculi, the Parallel Random Access Machine model and the Actor model.

In terms of graph theory, there is a directed circuit, in which processes and resources alternate exactly one by one, Starvation: This is mostly happens in time sharing systems in which the process which requires less time slot is waiting for the large process to finish and to release the resources but the large process holding the resources for long time (almost for forever) and the process that requires small time slot goes on waiting.
Such situation is starvation for small process.

                    <text>Because the waiter is aware of which forks are in use, he is able to arbitrate and prevent deadlock.
When four of the forks are in use, the next philosopher to request one has to wait for the waiter’s permission, which is not given until a fork has been released.
The logic is kept simple by specifying that philosophers always seek to pick up their left hand fork before their right hand fork (or vice versa).

If A and C are eating, four forks are in use.
B sits between A and C so has neither fork available, whereas D and E have one unused fork between them.

                    <text>Suppose D wants to eat.
Were he to take up the fifth fork, deadlock becomes likely.
If instead he asks the waiter and is told to wait, we can be sure that next time two forks are released there will certainly be at least one philosopher who could successfully request a pair of forks.
Therefore deadlock cannot happen.

                    <text>Resource hierarchy solution: Another simple solution is achieved by assigning a partial order to the resources (the forks, in this case), and establishing the convention that all resources will be requested in order, and released in reverse order, and that no two resources unrelated by order will ever be used by a single unit of work at the same time.
Here, the resources (forks) will be numbered 1 through 5, in some order, and each unit of work (philosopher) will always pick up the lower-numbered fork first, and then the higher-numbered fork, from among the two forks he plans to use.
Then, he will always put down the higher numbered fork first, followed by the lower numbered fork.

                    <text>In this case, if four of the five philosophers simultaneously pick up their lower-numbered fork, only the highest numbered fork will remain on the table, so the fifth philosopher will not be able to pick up any fork.
Moreover, only one philosopher will have access to that highest-numbered fork, so he will be able to eat using two forks.
When he finishes using the forks, he will put down the highest-numbered fork first, followed by the lower-numbered fork, freeing another philosopher to grab the latter and begin eating.

                    <text>While the resource hierarchy solution avoids deadlocks, it is not always practical, especially when the list of required resources is not completely known in advance.
For example, if a unit of work holds resources 3 and 5 and then determines it needs resource 2, it must release 5, then 3 before acquiring 2, and then it must re-acquire 3 and 5 in that order.
Computer programs that access large numbers ofdatabase records would not run efficiently if they were required to release all higher-numbered records before accessing a new record, making the method impractical for that purpose.

                    <text>In the absence of locks associated with the forks, philosophers must ensure that the decision to begin eating is not based on stale information about the state of the neighbors.
E.g. if philosopher B sees that A is not eating, then turns and looks at C, A could begin eating while B looks at C.
This solution avoids this problem by using a single mutual exclusion lock.
This lock is not associated with the forks but with the decision procedures that can change the states of the philosophers.

The procedures test, pickup and putdown are local to the monitor and share a mutual exclusion lock.
Notice that philosophers wanting to eat do not hold a fork.
When the monitor allows a philosopher who wants to eat to continue, the philosopher will reacquire the first fork before picking up the now available second fork.
When done eating, the philosopher will signal to the monitor that both forks are now available.

ANS: Virtual memory is a computer system technique which gives an application program the impression that it has contiguous working memory, while in fact it is physically fragmented and may even overflow on to disk storage.
Systems which use this technique make programming of large applications easier and use real physical memory (e.g. RAM) more efficiently than those without virtual memory.

                    <text>A useful way to think of a semaphore is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are available, coupled with operations to safely (i.e. without race conditions) adjust that record as units are required or become free, and if necessary wait until a unit of the resource becomes available.
Semaphores are a useful tool in the prevention of race conditions and deadlocks; however, their use is by no means a guarantee that a program is free from these problems.
Semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count are called counting semaphores, whilst semaphores which are restricted to the values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are called binary semaphores.

                    <text>It is a useful, memory-saving technique for multiprogrammed timesharing systems.
A Reentrant Procedure is one in which multiple users can share a single copy of a program during the same period.
Reentrancy has 2 key aspects: The program code cannot modify itself, and the local data for each user process must be stored separately.
Thus, the permanent part is the code, and the temporary part is the pointer back to the calling program and local variables used by that program.

                    <text>Each execution instance is called activation.
It executes the code in the permanent part, but has its own copy of local variables/parameters.
The temporary part associated with each activation is the activation record.
Generally, the activation record is kept on the stack.
Note: A reentrant procedure can be interrupted and called by an interrupting program, and still execute correctly on returning to the procedure.

                    <text>Also called FIFO anomaly.
Usually, on increasing the number of frames allocated to a process virtual memory, the process execution is faster, because fewer page faults occur.
Sometimes, the reverse happens, i.e., the execution time increases even when more frames are allocated to the process.
This is Belady's Anomaly.
This is true for certain page reference patterns.

This relates to processes that are in a blocked or suspended state.
They are swapped out of real-memory until they are ready to execute.
The swapping-in decision is based on memory-management criteria.

                    <text>Priority Scheduling: This method is quite same as the SJF but the difference is that instead of choosing the next process to work on by the shortest burst time, CPU chooses the next process by the shortest priority value.
Here, all the processes are given a priority value.
The process with the shortest (The most shortest is 1) priority will be worked on first and so on.

Well, as the unit of time you can take anything like nano-second, second, minute etc whatever.
We consider it as second.

Here in Priority Scheduling, what will happen is as follows, AT 0s:            There is only 1 job, that is Process-1 with Burst Time 3 and Priority 2.
So CPU will do 1 second job of Process-1.

Thus process-2 has more 1s job.

                    <text>We can show the above thing as the following time-line Process-1 Process-2 Process-2 Process-1 Process-1 Process-3 0s 1s 2s 3s 4s 5s A shortened view of the above time-line is as follows, | Process-1 | Process-2 | Process-1 | Process-3 | 0                 1 3 5 6 So now came the main thing, Waiting Time.
Ok, Look carefully, See the following time-line for Process-1.
Here, RED marked seconds symbolizes the seconds while Process-1 was waiting and GREEN marked second symbolizes the seconds while Process-1 was working.

                    <text>Process-1 Process-2 Process-2 Process-1 Process-1 Process-3 0s 1s 2s 3s 4s 5s Thus Process-1 waited for 2 seconds.
Process-2 did not wait, it came at 1s and worked at 1s and 2s.
But Process-3 Arrived at the List of Process at 2s with a Burst Time of 1s.

                    <text>But CPU started processing Process-3 at 5s.
So process-3 waited for 3s.
Process-1 Process-2 Process-2 Process-1 Process-1 Process-3 0s 1s 2s 3s 4s 5s So total waiting time = (Waiting Time of Process-1)+ (Waiting Time of Process-2)                                      + (Waiting Time of Process-3)                                    = (2+0+3)s                                   = 5s So the average waiting time is = (Total waiting time / Number of Processes)s                                                  = (5/3)s                                                  = 1.66s Ok...I think you have understood the thing.

                    <text>Now lets talk about the program.
Input: You will ask the user for the number of processes.
Then for each process you will take its Process Number, Arrival Time, Burst time and Priority.

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>You don’t have to worry, the number of processes wont be more than 5 or 6, Arrival time of a process can only be equal or greater than the arrival time of its previous process and Process will be entered as a serial number, so no problem.
Priority values of 2 processes wont be same.
Output: In the output you will have to print out the shortened time-line we showed you above.

                </section>
                <section>
                    <text>For example, if the input is as follows, Arrival Process Burst Time Priority 0 1 3 2 1 2 2 1 2 3 1 3 Then the shortened time-line will be, | Process-1 | Process-2 | Process-1 | Process-3 | 0                 1 3 5 6 You can also print out the time-line vertically if you want (thats what I have done, see the output of my program) Ok beneath this shortened time-line you will have to print a table as follows, Process Arrival Finish Total Wait 2 1 2 2 0 1 0 4 3 2 3 2 5 1 3                                              Beneath this, you will have to show the Average Waiting Time.
I know you have understood, now see a screen-shot of exactly what I was talking about, Exception: One exception is that, I said “Arrival time of a process can only be equal or greater than the arrival time of its previous process&quot;.
So take a look at the following list of process, Arrival Process Burst Time Priority 0 1 3 2 55 2 2 1 60 3 1 3 You see, the Job of Process-1 will complete at 2s, thus from 3s to 54s the CPU will remain idle.

                <section>
                    <text>Again the job of Process-2 will complete at 56s and thus from 57s to 59s the CPU will again remain as idle.
You have to show this in the output and also notice that none of the processes has waited.

                    <text>But that doesn't mean it's perfect, of course.
If you've moved to Windows 7 recently then you might have noticed various upgrade problems, interface issues and features that seem to have disappeared entirely, among many other complications with the new system.

                    <text>* 18 cool things Windows 7 does that Vista doesn't 1.
Vista upgrade hangs at 62% Windows 7 can start causing problems before it's even installed, as many people report their upgrade hangs forever at 62%.
Which is annoying.

                    <text>Reboot, and your PC should roll back to Windows Vista.
You can then open the setup log file \$WINDOWS.
BT\Sources\Panther\setupact.log to view what happened.
Microsoft say this is usually caused because the Iphlpsvc service has stopped responding, and just adding an environment variable to ignore it will fix the problem.
Point your browser at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/975253 for the fix.

                    <text>If this doesn't help (or your upgrade hangs at something other than 62%) then browse the setup log for other clues.
And you might also try to boot and install from the Windows 7 disc, if possible, as that reduces the chance of any conflict with your existing Vista (or XP) setup.

                    <text>No change?
Resetting the drive letter has worked for some.
Click Start, type Disk Management and choose the &quot;Create and format hard disk partitions&quot; link.
If your optical drive is visible here then right-click it, select Change Drive Letter and Paths, click Change and choose a new letter.
If the drive is now visible in Explorer, then repeat the process to change the drive letter back; if it's still not visible, reboot and it should appear.

                    <text>3. Aero isn't running If Windows 7 isn't looking its best - transparency has been turned off, say - then the Aero theme may not have been fully enabled on your system.
Click Start, type Aero, choose the &quot;Find and fix problems with transparency and other visual effects&quot; link, and click Next to launch the Aero troubleshooting wizard.
It'll try to identify and resolve and problems.
And if it doesn't, then install the latest driver for your graphics hardware.
That could be all your system needs.

                    <text>Some Aero features may be disabled in the Registry, though.
For example, if Aero Peek (the ability to make open windows transparent to display your desktop underneath) doesn't work for you, then launch REGEDIT, browse to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM and make sure EnableAeroPeek is set to 1, rather than 0.

Aero Snap irritations Windows 7's new ability to move and resize windows, all in one movement, can be a genuine productivity boost.
But if you find windows moving around when you don't expect it then Aero Snap is more of an annoyance than anything else, though at least it's one you can disable in just a few seconds.

                    <text>5. iPhone won't sync in Windows 7 Irritated iPhone users are beginning to report major difficulties in getting their iPhone to sync with Windows 7 systems.
Particularly 64-bit Windows 7 systems, based around the P55 chipset.
The iPhone is usually (though not always) recognised, but iTunes then complains that it can't connect to the unit because of an &quot;unknown error&quot;, usually (though again, not always) 0xE8000065.

Click Start, type DEVMGMT.MSC and press [Enter] to launch Device Manager, then click View &gt; Devices By Type.
Expand the Universal Serial Bus controllers section of the tree, right-click each USB Root Hub entry in turn, select Properties &gt; Power Management, and clear &quot;Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power&quot;.

Windows 7 themes change your custom icons Windows 7 has some spectacular new themes - there's a great selection at the Microsoft site - but installing them can have one annoying side-effect.
If you've previously changed a system icon like Computer or the Recycle Bin then that could disappear, replaced by the equivalent icon from the theme pack.

                    <text>Ensure that there is enough I/O bandwidth, CPU power, and swap space.
Do not expect, however, that further tuning of the operating system will have a significant effect on application performance.
Changes in the Oracle configuration or in the application are likely to result in a more significant difference in operating system efficiency than simply tuning the operating system.

Nonetheless, these structures can consume resources while offering little or no benefit to performance.
This is most noticeable on a UNIX system that has the database files in the UNIX file store; by default, all database I/O goes through the file system cache.

                    <text>On some UNIX systems, direct I/O is available to the filestore.
This arrangement allows the database files to be accessed within the UNIX file system, bypassing the file system cache.
It saves CPU resources and allows the file system cache to be dedicated to non-database activity, such as program texts and spool files.

                    <text>Although the operating system cache is often redundant because the Oracle buffer cache buffers blocks, there are a number of cases where Oracle does not use the Oracle buffer cache.
In these cases, using direct I/O which bypasses the UNIX or operating system cache, or using raw devices which do not use the operating system cache, may yield worse performance than using operating system buffering.
Some examples include:

It can then continue processing.
With asynchronous I/O, processing continues while the I/O request is submitted and processed.
Use asynchronous I/O when possible to avoid bottlenecks.

In such systems, it is common for operating system reporting tools to show that there is no free memory, which is not generally a problem.
If processes require more memory, the memory caching I/O data is usually released to allow the process memory to be allocated.

                    <text>9.1.3 Using Operating System Resource Managers Some platforms provide operating system resource managers.
These are designed to reduce the impact of peak load use patterns by prioritizing access to system resources.
They usually implement administrative policies that govern which resources users can access and how much of those resources each user is permitted to consume.

Like domains, the separate resource areas are dedicated only to the processing assigned to that area; processes cannot migrate across boundaries.
Unlike domains, all other resources (usually disk) are accessed by all partitions on a system.

On a busy system, free memory likely contains a page belonging to one or more currently active process.
When that access occurs, asoft page fault takes place, and the page is included in the working set for the process.
If the process cannot expand its working set, then one of the pages currently mapped by the process must be moved to the free set.

There is an overhead in processing messages.
When an application generates many messages that need to be sent through the network, the latency of sending a message can result in CPU overload.
To alleviate this problem, bundle multiple messages together rather than perform lots of round trips.
For example, you can use array inserts, array fetches, and so on.

This can involve an operating system call that incurs a relatively costly context switch.
Some platforms implement a memory-mapped timer that uses an address within the processes virtual address space to contain the current time information.
Reading the time from this memory-mapped timer is less expensive than the overhead of a context switch for a system call.

                    <text>A data management platform that dynamically runs across many machines requires—as a foundation—a fast, scalable, fault-tolerant distributed system.
It is well-known, however, thatdistributed systems have unavoidable tradeoffs 3 and notoriously complex implementation challenges 4 .

                    <text>Introduced at PODC 2000 by Eric Brewer 5 and formally proven by Seth Gilbert and Nancy Lynch in 2002 6 , the CAP Theorem, in particular, stipulates that it is impossible for a distributed system to be simultaneously:Consistent, Available, and Partition-Tolerant.
At any given time, only two of these three desirable properties can be achieved.
Hence when building distributed systems, design tradeoffs must be made.

                    <text>Eventually Consistent Solutions Are Not Always Viable Driven by awareness of CAP limitations, a popular design approach for scaling Web-oriented applications is to anticipate that large-scale systems will inevitably encounter network partitions and to thereforerelax consistency in order to allow services to remain highly available even as partitions occur 7 .
Rather than go down and interrupt user service upon network outages, many Web user applications—e.g., customer shopping carts, email search, social network queries—can tolerate stale data and adequately merge conflicts, possibly guided by help from end users once partitions are fixed.
Several so-calledeventually consistent platforms designed for partition-tolerance and availability—largely inspired by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft—are available as products, cloud-based services, or even derivative, open source community projects.

                    <text>Business rules do not permit relaxed consistency, so invariants like account trading balances must be enforced by strong transactional consistency semantics.
In application terms, the cost of anapology 8 makes rollback too expensive, so many high-speed financial applications must limit workflow exposure traditionally by relying onOLTP systems with ACID guarantees.

Eventually consistent approaches are not applicable.
Distributed databases using two phase commit provide transactional guarantees but only so long as all nodes see each other.
Quorum based approaches provide consistency but block service availability during network partitions.

                    <text>Our Solution: The EDF Any choice of distributed system design—shared memory, shared-disk, or shared-nothing architecture—has inescapableCAP tradeoffs with downstream implications on data correctness and concurrency.
High-level design choices also impact throughput and latency as well as programmability models, potentially imposing constraints on schema flexibility and transactional semantics.

By simply connecting more machine nodes, theEDF scales data storage horizontally.
Within a data partition (not to be confused with network partitions), data entries are key/value pairs with thread-based, read-your-writes7 consistency.

                    <text>The isolation of data into partitions creates a service-oriented design pattern where related partitions can be grouped into abstractions calledservice entities 11 .
A service entity is deployed on a single machine at a time where it owns and manages a discrete collection of data—a holistic chunk of the overall business schema—hence, multiple data entries colocated within a service entity can be queried and updated transactionally, independent of data within another service entity.

                <section>
                    <text>Mining The Gap In C-A-P From a CAP perspective, service entities enable the EDF to exploit a well-known approach to fault tolerance based onpartial-failure modes, fault isolation, and graceful degradation of service 12 .
Service entities allow application designers to demarcate units of survivability in the face of network faults.
So rather than striving for complete partition-tolerance (an impossible result) when consistency and availability must be prioritized, theEDF implements arelaxed, weakened form of partition-tolerance that isolates the effects of network failuresenabling the maximum number of services to remain fully consistent and available when network splits occur.

                    <text>By configuring membership roles (reflecting service entity responsibilities) for each member of the distributed system, customers can orthogonally (in a lightweight, non-invasive, declarative manner) encode business semantics that give theEDF the ability to decide under what circumstances a member node can safely continue operating after a disruption caused by network failure.
Membership roles perform application decomposition by encapsulating the relationship of one system member to another, expressing causal data dependencies, message stability rules (defining what attendant members must be reachable), loss actions (what to do if required roles are absent), and resumption actions (what to do when required roles rejoin).

                    <text>For example, membership roles can identify independent subnetworks in a complex workflow application.
So long as interdependent producer and consumer activities are present after a split, reads and writes to their data partitions can safely continue.
Rather than arbitrarily disabling an entire losing side during network splits, theEDF consults fine-grained knowledge of service-based role dependencies and keeps as many services consistently available as possible.

For example, in an e-commerce site, acquisition of shopping cart items is prioritized as a high-write availability scenario, i.e., an e-retailer wants shopping cart data to be highly available even at the cost of weakened consistency, lest service interruption stalls impulse purchases, or worse yet, ultimately forces customers to visit competitor store fronts.

                    <text>Once items are placed in the shopping cart and the order is clicked, automated order fulfillment workflows re-prioritize for data consistency (at the cost of weakened availability) since no live customer is waiting for the next Web screen to appear; if an activity blocks, another segment of the automated workflow can be alternatively launched, or the activity can be retried.
In addition to changingCAP requirements, data mutability requirements also change—e.g., at the front end of a workflow, data may be write-intensive; whereas afterward, during bulk processing, the same captured data may be accessed in read-only or read-mostly fashion.

The EDF employspartitioned and pipelined parallelism to perform distributed queries, aggregation, and internal distribution operations on behalf of user applications.

Similarly, business data schemas and workloads frequently consist of multi-step operations on uniform (e.g., sequential time series) data streams.
These operations can be composed into parallel data flow graphs where the output of one operator is streamed into the input of another; hence multiple operators can work continuously in task pipelines.

                    <text>External applications can use the FunctionService API to create Map/Reduce programs that run in parallel over data in the EDF.
Rather than data flowing from many nodes into a single client application, control (Runnable functions) logic flows from the application to many machines in theEDF.
This dramatically reduces process execution time as well as network bandwidth.

By default, the EDF uses a hashing policy where a data entry key is hashed to compute a random bucket mapped to a member node.
The physical location of the key-value pair is virtualized from the application.

                    <text>Custom partitioning, on the other hand, enables applications to colocate related data entries together to form service entities.
For example, a financial risk analytics application can colocate all trades, risk sensitivities, and reference data associated with a single instrument in the same region.
Using the FunctionService, control flow can then be directly routed to specific nodes holding particular data sets; hence queries can be localized and then aggregated in parallel increasing the speed of execution when compared to a distributed query.

If application requests do not find data in the client cache, the data is automatically fetched from theEDF by the server.
As modifications to shared regions occur, these updates areautomatically pushed to clients where applications receive realtime event notifications.
Likewise, modifications initiated by a client application are sent to the server and then pushed to other applications listening for region updates.

                    <text>Extension: AJAX AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML , technologies that can be used on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications.
With AJAX, web applications can send data to, and retrieve data from, a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.
Examples of this might be receiving a new email in your web based mail client without having to refresh the page manually, another example is a breaking news article appearing on a news site without you having to refresh the page.Web 2.0 sites make heavy use of AJAX and data is usually retrieved using theXMLHttpRequest API.

If you purchased from a retailer using a credit card perform a charge back which will get you your money back, no problems.

Better just to ask support for your money back; especially in light of Square Enix's response.

I've actually never faced any problem in the game single nor multiplayer that would seem suspicious, besides the few multiplayer connection bugs that everyone else have.

I've written because, of course not a problem of 64-bit system.
There are thousands of configurations of computers in the world, yours probably has bugs, or have a program that causes errors with the game.
Deltra03-08-2010, 02:31 PMI have a Dell, recently upgraded to Windows 7 64 bit, with a Geforce 8600M, and so far the game is running just fine.
Not running dual monitors though, so also can't comment on that.

I'm not doubting your claim, just suggesting that this maybe isn't the right explanation.

DrSuperGood03-08-2010, 03:10 PMThe whole compatibility problem with 32 in 64 bit OS was because XP 64 was not particually that good (which resulted in such claims).

                <section>
                    <text>The only real compatibility problem is that 64 bit OS need 64 bit drivers for some hardware which do not exist (in the case of old or no longer supported harware).
Next to that, from my experinece 64 bit OS are identical to their 32 bit counterparts but with additional functionality like support for 64 bit executables (generally faster than 32 bit for some tasks).

                    <text>There is a high chance that the problems you are reporting might occur even on 32 bit OS versions.
There is also a high chance that the cause is due to driver problems (the game is getting unexpected feedback from drivers).
Buttons 03-08-2010, 03:36 PMI think the main point of this thread is that Square Enix support is just grabbing at straws trying to get out of providing support for their product.
Give support or give refunds please.

But all I could gather from the posts is &quot;the 2nd monitor is acting abit strange&quot; Subsparx03-08-2010, 04:01 PMMyself and all my friends I know who have Supreme commander have dual monitors and 64 bit Vista or 7 and none of us have any issues.

                    <text>Regarding the OP's post, it makes perfect sense.
Nowhere does it say that it's only for 32 bit OS's, so he has a point.
Problem is if it's with Steam may not be likely.
Here's a story of my own:

The retail box said dedicated server.
Game was released without dedi servers.
I contacted Codemasters, they apologized and even told me to ask for a refund from my retailer and they admitted the box art was deceptive.

Get an email from Square Enix about how they recommend that particular model computer that comes with the 64 bit OS.

I just didn't read the bullcrap properly.
But this has nothing to do with the actual matter at hand.
The point is that even though the company doesn't recommend it with 64-bit Windows, it has worked in previous games and it works in this game for other people, so the problem is NOT the 64-bit OS, but the OP's individual system so the thread title is wrong. gpgsteve 03-08-2010, 04:12 PMHi there.

Supreme Commander 2 does work with 64-bit OSes; many of us here are using them.
There is no specific support for 64-bit, i.e. an actual 64-bit executable.

The issue is that if the OP had a problem with a 32 bit OS, then Square is obligated to offer support for the problem and to continue troubleshooting until a solution is achieved.

I find it absolutely ridiculous that both Square and EA have denied official support for 64 bit OS's which is the 2nd most popular OS as far as Steam games go, but that's reality and it sucks.

It's a cop-out.
I've seen a lot of pieces of software that do not support Windows 7 or Vista.
Vista had been out 6 months and a lot of games and other software had no official Vista support, so they just told the Vista owners to take a walk.

LA Snow03-08-2010, 08:04 PMI've heard of people contacting their credit card companies about charge backs.
Be completely honest to ensure you don't violate any laws, but if a PC game is sold without proper documentation on the box, or fails to function, then I think it's legal to have your credit card company do a charge back which forcibly removes money from the retailers account and back into your own.

This itself might be open to legal action as if the credit card company legally and rightfully (assuming all is legal and right, I don't really know) performs a charge back for a defective product, and then steam locks your account, then Steam has locked your account even though you've operated within the law.
You'd need a lawyer of course.
This is all hear-say, I know nothing about this first hand.

You file a report with your bank and indicate the situation.
They move forward and contact Visa or Mastercard who reimburses them, and in turn, takes money away from the merchant.
The bank and the merchant both have agreements they have to accept in order to have the Visa or Mastercard logo present on the cards, and to accept them in the store.

Issues a chargeback, but Mastercard needed proof that I paid via other means.

I don't see how this does not violate their Visa or Mastercard agreement.
My assumption is that they allow the chargeback and if Visa or MC takes the money, then Steam has to release it, but then they kick in the subscriber agreement about how it can be terminated at any time.

Normally a business accepting Visa and MC are held to certain standards.
If they fail to meet these standards, then they are not allowed to accept credit cards and must only accept things like PayPal.

Spikx03-09-2010, 12:37 PMPeople, the issue here is, that he can't enable the secondary video adapter, not that he can't run the game at all.
This might as well be an issue with DirectX or the GPU driver he is using.
Being able to use the second video adapter depends heavily on that, not just on the implementation of the application using it.

Hard to say without further testing.
I'll get my copy probably tomorrow, then I will be able to try this as well in my Windows 7 x64.

                    <text>Btw.The game was advertised as working with dual monitors and it was never mentioned that the OS needed to be 32bit.there are other factors as well that contribute to whether or not you will be able to use the secondary video adapter.
For example, up until recently, NVidia drivers did not allow using the secondary video adapter by 3D applications when running in SLI mode.
Apparently they finally improved on that in the recent driver version (which were nuked by them again, since there is a serious bug in the latest 2 driver version, which could cause your NVidia GPU to simply of heat ;)).

One of them is that retailers cannot require anything but a signature to verify your Visa purchase.
Remember that next time someone asks for your drivers licence just because you used a Visa.
Just a side note.

Supreme Commander 2 does work with 64-bit OSes; many of us here are using them.
There is no specific support for 64-bit, i.e. an actual 64-bit executable.

Dual-monitor (and I think in the OP's case, the issue is tied to Eyefinity) issues notwithstanding, any chance you can run the flag up the pole with Squeenix and get their support to stop looking for reasons not to provide support?
Doesn't Microsoft have something in place where if you're getting the Win7 logo, you are supporting both flavors of 7?

                    <text>Whether that's true or not, it would have been cooler for support to have tried to sort out the Eyefinity conflict (or general multi-monitor support, if that's the case) instead of hiding behind 64 little bitty bits.
Thanks!

As feedback has reported, almost every 64 bit user is running it fine.

                    <text>Additionally, any problem with multiple monitor support might not even be caused by 64bit OS, they could mearly be a driver bug with the actual game.
Inorder for the statement to be valid that the 64 bit OS have problem with multi screen support, the same computers using the same hardware and same drivers need to run a 32 bit OS to check if it works then.
As a rough guess there is a very high chance that the same multi monitor support issues may exist for both 32 and 64 bit OS versions unless the bug is caused by the display drivers in which case it is not the problem of the game developers and infact is the problem of the hardware supplier.

That &quot;tech support&quot; answer was basically a cop-out. koreanbear03-10-2010, 12:39 AMSpeaking of Visa terms.
One of them is that retailers cannot require anything but a signature to verify your Visa purchase.
Remember that next time someone asks for your drivers licence just because you used a Visa.
Just a side note.

                    <text>On topic: I will be trying this out myself this weekend.
I am currently running Win7 64 with an ATI 5770 with the 10.2 drivers as well.
Getting a 32 inch HDtv to replace my 24 inch monitor as my main.
If this works my battle map will be at a 1920 X 1200 res while my game will run at 1920 X 1080.
If it doesn't I am pretty sure it is the drivers or an eyefinity issue.

They also have the right to refuse you service for any reason.
We live in fraudulent times so if it is such an inconvenience for you to show your ID they will think you stole the card.
While that may not be true they have no way of knowing.

That is true but they still have the product to sell again to someone presenting a safer transaction to them.
If they sell the merchandise in hopes the CC is good and it gets chargedback, They are out of money overall instead of in the short term.

The OS knows if a program can be executed in 64 bit, like stated by someone else.
If its not, then windows is 100% capable of running it in 32 bit.
If you examine your program files folder, you will see Program Files, and Program files (x86). everything thats 32 bit (will by default) install here.

Yes it should be require and there should be some form on digital signature online created, I have been a victim of credit card theft (somehow) and it cost me nearly 200 dollars.
Granted i did get this money back but before this, I said 'this will never happen to me' well it can happen to anyone, I can assure you that. suprimos03-10-2010, 09:53 AMuntil now it works good for me with win 7 64bit ultimate Aesir Rising03-10-2010, 10:28 AM But, I would like someone to elaborate that when companies use the Windows 7 logo, it means they support both 32 and 64 bit platforms.

                    <text>Unsupported means one of two things: 1.
It was tested and problems were found.
2. It was not tested.
In the case of SupCom on x64 I believe they mean &quot;not tested&quot;.

If it works, good for you.
If it does not work then &quot;best effort&quot; support is given.
The solution given by support may ultimately end up being: &quot;move to a supported platform&quot; If a bug is found it is unlikly to be fixed.

Good for you that it works but this does not mean that those that are having trouble are merely the victims of user error.

I tend to believe it's more of a dual monitor issue on x64 than just an x64 issue.
However without root cause it's all speculation.

Sir_Brizz03-11-2010, 10:41 AMI would love to know the likelihood that this game was developed on 32-bit systems on 32-bit OSes.
I think the chances of that are extremely remote.
I've been to some rinky dink tiny developers, and even they are running 64 bit OSes on computers they had built for them by an outside company.

Having worked in support for ages, I can say that most support divisions are encouraged to find a reason they shouldn't help you to keep their response times low and their stats high.

Try setting your Anti-Aliasing to Off.
If that doesn't work (I know this sounds weird) try setting your AA to 8 or 16.
Don't forget that you need to restart for each of these changes to take effect.

Really the game is just plain buggy and unfinished with a lot of patches to come im sure.
Each person seems to experience their own issues sometimes independent of others with the same hardware setup.
I'm using Win7 Pro 64-bit, AMD 940BE Quadcore, 4gb ram, GTX260, and experience no problems at all.

Smooth gameplay, but many of the same general issues others encounter.
Sorry for all experiencing problems but give it a few months of refining and I think we'll see a much better SupCom2.
I don't think a single person on the Dev team could deny they sold and marketed what is basically a late stage beta game.

But it's been pointed out that folks are just having issues with dual-monitor support and perhaps Eyefinity.
I have neither so I only have skimmed those topics here and at ati.com's catalyst forum.

Aesir Rising03-18-2010, 02:39 PMThat's all great for everyone, including myself, running 7x64 *pats everyone on the back* But the OPs request for support from Squeenix was rejected on the grounds that he was running a 64-bit OS.
They didn't look at his issue.

It's in the &quot;crash dump XML&quot; format = Application Crash.

They all do but not SC2!DX 9.0c != DX 9.0c.
While other games may rund with older version of DX 9.0c, Supreme Commander 2 needs at least the August 2009 version.
Which you should have anyway, since the install script of Steam installs it on the first run, so that's probably not your issue, but who knows.

Just open a thread with a detailed problem description (i.e. when exactly does it crash, do you run it through Steam or via the .exe directly, etc.) and post a dxdiag there (preferably paste it on pastebin.com and post a link, don't paste the dxdiag directly, it's a bit annoying ;)).

It is very likely that you assume your DX10/11 updates actually include the DX9 updates that are required for this DX9-based game, and there is no evidence to the contrary, since you are unwilling to provide a DXDiag for us to analyze.

The only thing that will cause issues is hardware or software.

I saw one of the GPG guys come on a thread and say that. sorian06-05-2010, 12:57 PMNot sure what SE's stance is, but since a good majority of our dev machines are 64 bit I don't see why it wouldn't run on a 64-bit OS.

Actually, this is the first game that runs great for me!
Mabey because I use AMD....I don't know. truescot06-06-2010, 11:15 AMonce again the start of this post was complaing that there was no support provided by square enix for an issue with the game on that specific computer due to the fact that that it had an x64 OS He did not say that it will not run on any x64 machine.

Instead of writing 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, I used 5! whichelicits the same result.
Looking back our definition of why recursion is used, we seem to solve big problems by solving smaller instances of the same problem, so factorials are ripe for recursion:

This trace table will be different from the ones that you have built before as we are going to have to use a stack.

Now what do we do?
We'll soon have two values of n, one for Function call 1 and one for Function call 2.
Using the trace table as a stack (with the bottom of the stack at the top and the top of the stack at the bottom) we'll save all the data about the function call including its value of n and make note of what line we need to return to when we have finished with factorial(3).

But where do we go now?
There is nothing left on the stack and we have finished the code.
Therefore the result is 24.

Recursion summary Recursion does have some issues though, consider how much data we had to store on the stack for just 4 function calls.
If we were to perform 1000, the memory used would be incredibly large.

                    <text>  Recently, a non-programmer friend pointed out that there is no simple explanation of capabilities available on the web.
Less than a week later, another friend -- this one a senior operating system developer for a major UNIX software company -- said to me that he really didn't understand what I was working on (capabilities).
If neither the lay reader nor the experts understand what these things are, an introductory description isdefinitely needed, so I set out to write one.

                    <text>I quickly discovered that doing so isn't easy.
Capabilities themselves are very simple, but they turn everything people &quot;know&quot; about security upside down.
A lot of people look at them and say &quot;this is too simple to possibly work.&quot;

There are a number of places to go to get more detailed information.

                    <text>* This essay is partisan.
I have chosen to talk about one particular style of capability system.
I think it's the best one, but others are worth looking at if you get a hankering to do so.
If you get to the point of comparing capability systems, you are past the point of askingwhat they are and are now askinghow they should be implemented.
That, however, is a subject for a different essay.

                    <text>This essay will tell you what the term access control covers, what a capability is, and provide some examples of how capabilities can be used to provide flexible access to objects without giving up security.
I'll describe some problems that currently popular access control mechanisms cannot handle.
I'll talk about the problem ofrevoking access, and how this is solved.
Finally, I'll give my own opinion on how capabilities came to be rejected by mainstream computing people.

                    <text>1.  The Problem: Access Control The basic problem of computer security is to control which objects a given program can access, and in what ways.
Objects are things like files, sound cards, other programs, the network, your modem, and so forth.
Access means what kind of operations can be done on these objects.
Examples include reading a file, writing to a file, creating or deleting objects, communicating with another program, etc.

I should not be able to read your medical records, for example.
You should not be able to delete my work.
This is the what most people mean when they talk about computer security.

You want to ensure that a program or a user doesn't do more than you mean them to.
For example, you might want to run a program off of the Web but prevent the program from reading or writing any files so that it cannot plant a computer virus or give away your private phone book.
This issue has been getting more attention lately with all of the hype around Java.

You may want to allow two people to work together on a document or to grant access to a particular file to someone else so that you can delegate a job to them.
Note however, that you probably want to do this selectively.
Just because we are working on a business plan together doesn't mean that I should get to read your medical records.
From a practical perspective, this is just as important as the first two, but security people don't tend to think about it very much.

                    <text>2.  What a Capability Is The term capability was introduced by Dennis and Van Horn in 1966 in a paper entitledProgramming Semantics for Multiprogrammed Computations.
The basic idea is this: suppose we design a computer system so that in order to access an object, a program must have a special token.
This tokendesignates an object and gives the program the authority to perform a specific set of actions (such as reading or writing) on that object.
Such a token is known as a capability.

                    <text>A capability is a lot like the keys on your key ring.
As an example, consider your car key.
It works on a specific car (it designates a particular object), and anyone holding the key can perform certain actions (locking or unlocking the car, starting the car, opening the glove compartment).

Holding your car key won't let me test drive my neighbor's Lamborghini (which is just as well -- I would undoubtedly wrap it around a tree somewhere).
Note that the car key doesn't know that it's me starting the car; it's sufficient that I possess the key.
In the same way,capabilities do not care who uses them.

                    <text>Car keys sometimes come in several variations.
Two common ones are the valet key (starts, locks, and unlocks the car, but not the glove compartment) or the door key (locks/unlocks the car, but won't start it).
In exactly this way, two capabilities can designate the same object(such as the car) but authorize different sets of actions.
One program might hold a read-only capability to a file while another holds a read-write capability to the same file.

A rescinded capability conveys no authority to do anything at all.

Creating a new kind of capability (for example: one that lets me inquire about the size of a file, but not read it) is simply a matter of adding a little bit of software.

                    <text>3.  Capability-Based Computer Systems In a capability-based computer system, all access to objects is done through capabilities, and capabilities provide theonly means of accessing objects.
In such a system, every program holds a set of capabilities.
If program A holds a capability to talk to program B, then the two programs can grant capabilities to each other.

                    <text>In most capability systems, a program can hold an infinite number of capabilities.
Such systems have tended to be slow.
A better design allows each program to hold a fixed (and small -- like 16 or 32) number of capabilities, and provides a means for storing additional capabilities if they are needed.
The only way to obtain capabilities is to have them granted to you as a result of some communication.

The goal is to make the set of capabilities held by each program as specific and as small as possible, because a program cannot abuse authority it does not have.
This is known as theprinciple of least privilege.

If a program is running on behalf of Natasha (my other dog), it can open any of the files that Natasha created.
Such a system is called anaccess control list (ACL) system.

Once they have the capability, they can manipulate the object itself.
This is the purpose of the UNIXopen system call.

Unless she owns the object, she cannot modify the access control list.

                    <text>A Better Solution: Universal Persistence A better solution is not to have a common file system, and not to give any program access to the file system by default.
File systems are very useful, but most programs and subsystems do not need access to them.
A spell checker that runs as part of a word processor, for example, needs access to the particular files it works on, but has no need to open any other files (and therefore no need of access to a file system).

The solution is to simply remembereverything.
Every five minutes, write down all of the things the computer is working on.
If Sheena pulls the plug, the system simply comes back to the last saved copy.
Since the saved copy includes all of the running programs, there is no need to figure out who is entitled to what when the system restarts.

In a capability system, you simply give the program a capability to the password database and let it run forever.
You then give out a capability that lets people run the password program but does not let them read or modify that program.

I'm afraid to give out the binary code, because somebody will decompile it and steal my program (yes, this really does happen).
You have some very secret data concerning the results of a new drug trial.
You need to run my program, but you're not willing to show me the data.

                    <text>In a capability system, we can set things up so that you can run the program without being able to see the code, but you are able to control what authority my program is given.
Since you control the authorities, you can ensure that my program will not tell me your secrets.
Since you cannot gain access to the binary code, you cannot steal the program.
Most computer security experts believe that this is impossible.
In ACL systems, it reallyis impossible.

In capability systems, another solution is possible: build a software-enforced special compartment that prevents the documents from being copied out of the compartment, and only let the user access those documents inside the compartment.

The early capability systems were built in hardware before we knew a lot about hardware architecture, and used capabilities for access to main memory.
This made them terribly slow and terribly complex.
Those systems are a good bit less complex than today's operating systems, but their reputation persists.

Until this changes, there is no reason to do secure systems.

The method reviewed here can be implemented to solve a linear system $\begin{array}{ccccccccc} a_{11}x_{1} &amp; + &amp; a_{12}x_{2} &amp; + &amp; \ldots &amp; + &amp; a_{1n}x_{n} &amp; = &amp; b_{1} \\ a_{21}x_{1} &amp; + &amp; a_{22}x_{2} &amp; + &amp; \ldots &amp; + &amp; a_{2n}x_{n} &amp; = &amp; b_{2} \\ \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\ a_{m1}z_{1} &amp; + &amp; a_{m2}x_{2} &amp; + &amp; \ldots &amp; + &amp; a_{mn}x_{n} &amp; = &amp; b_{m} \\ \end{array}$ of any size.
We write this system in matrix form as $$ \left[\begin{array}{cccc} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1n}\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{2n}\\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots\\ a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{mn} \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1\\ x_2\\ \vdots\\ x_n \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} b_1\\ b_2\\ \vdots\\ b_m \end{array} \right] $$ That is, $ A{\bf x} = {\bf b}. $ We can capture all the information contained in the sytem in the singleaugmented matrix $$ \Matrix{ a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1n} &amp; &amp; b_{1}\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{2n} &amp;\|&amp; b_{2}\\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp;\|&amp; \vdots\\ a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{mn} &amp; &amp; b_{m}\\ } $$ We will solve the original system of linear equations by performing a sequence of the following elementary row operations on the augmented matrix:

When a sequence of elementary row operations is performed on an augmented matrix, the linear system that corresponds to the resulting augmented matrix is equivalent to the original system.

Our strategy in solving linear systems, therefore, is to take an augmented matrix for a system and carry it by means of elementary row operations to an equivalent augmented matrix from which the solutions of the system are easily obtained.
In particular, we bring the augmented matrix to Row-Echelon Form:

The system is inconsistent.

                    <text>I'll type the specs below, but as far as I know things should be working.
I've already replaced the motherboard and the processor to get RMA's but things still aren't working.
I've checked the connector/pin/SATA cable arrangements and they're all in the correct spots.
I'm chalking it up as a defective or incompatible power supply at the moment, but I want to make sure that's the case, so if anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated.

                    <text>Build: • Old Motherboard: ASRock H77 M (LGA1155) • New/Working Motherboard: MSI Z77A-G41 (LGA1155) • CPU/Processor: Intel i5 3450 Processor (LGA 1155) • Graphics Card: AMD Radeon HD 7750 Series • Computer Case: Diablotek EVO ATX Mid Tower • RAM: (UPDATE)- 2 x 4gb Corsair Vengeance DDR3 1600 • Power Supply: CORSAIR CX Series CX750 750W To be more specific, when I complete the build, turn on the power supply switch to on, and try on the power supply, nothing happens.
My brother, who's handy with computers, has already done the trick with power supplies to see if electricity is circulating through it and it did work as the fans were spinning when the test was done.
Right now I'm just very disappointed because this is like $260 that has so much potential yet it doesn't work.

Also had to buy new RAM.

I'll try the bare bones test, thanks. #2 le'ocean Dec 15, 2012 @ 11:55am  power switch on? all wires connected to mobo? clear that cmos - rma that mobo #3 le'ocean Dec 15, 2012 @ 11:56am  or if you get red led light on mobo, in compatible ram #4 &lt;s&gt;2CardBoardBox Dec 15, 2012 @ 12:14pm  @_I_, Bare Bones test is negative.

                    <text>When I turn on the power supply my keyboard's Caps, Number, and Scroll lock indicators light up for a second and then go blank, this didn't happen when I reconnected the hd_audio and usb connectors though, not sure if that's normal.
Pressing the power button does nothing as usual.

                    <text>@green cheese, Power switch is definitely on and all the wires were connected to the motherboard.
I've already replaced the motherboard which took a grueling 3 weeks to complete, but I suppose it is possible that I've gotten a second defective motherboard, quite a pain in the ♥♥♥ if that were the case ..

                    <text>And there was no light, sound, beep, or any kind of response when trying to turn the computer on.
Only the ephemeral, short-lived caps, num, and scr locks that lit up for one second then blacked out was the response to turning the power supply on.

                    <text>Other than that, nothing worked. #5 le'ocean Dec 15, 2012 @ 12:20pm  make sure that processor is seated corectly.. but my best bet is the mobo again. know anyone with same mobo you can test your parts on?
do you even get a post?

                    <text>Processor is definitely placed in correctly, both the cpu and heatsink.
No, I don't know anyone with the same mobo, and I don't know what you mean by your second question but if you're asking if I got any response at all, it's a no.

                    <text>It's a bit heartbreaking if it's the motherboard, though, because that's pretty much another 3 weeks of waiting for a second RMA.
But thanks for the assistance. #7 le'ocean Dec 15, 2012 @ 12:25pm  well not the same mobo but a 1155, what i ment by post was the boot screen bios options.. but like you said you get nothing. #8 &lt;s&gt;2CardBoardBox Dec 15, 2012 @ 2:04pm  Originally posted bygreen cheese :well not the same mobo but a 1155, what i ment by post was the boot screen bios options.. but like you said you get nothing.

This is just ridiculous.

Or any other comments or suggestions are of course greatly appreciated. #10 - CJ - [DSS]

                    <text>First Come First Served (FCFS): CPU gets a lot of processes to handle.
The problem is shortening the waiting time for a process to reach CPU and get processed.
Now consider a CPU and also consider a list in which the processes are listed as follows, Arrival Process Burst Time 0 1 3 1 2 2 2 3 1 Here, Arrival is the time when the process has arrived the list, Process Number is used instead of the process name, and Burst Time is the amount of time required by the process from CPU.

                    <text>Well, as the unit of time you can take anything like nano-second, second, minute etc whatever.
We consider it as second.
Now for an instance, consider the above list as the ready queue for the CPU, that is the CPU will take processes from this list and will process it.

                    <text>Here in FCFS, CPU will take the first process in the list and will process it, then it will take the second process and so on.
So this is a very easy thing to do huh !
Ok.

                    <text>So, lets see what CPU is doing, At Time 0s Doing 1s time Unit Job of Process-1, so Process-1 has left 2s Time Unit JobAt Time 1s Doing 1s time Unit Job of Process-1, so Process-1 has left 1s Time Unit JobAt Time 2s Doing 1s time Unit Job of Process-1, so Process-1 has left 0s Time Unit JobAt Time 3s Doing 1s time Unit Job of Process-2, so Process-2 has left 1s Time Unit JobAt Time 4s Doing 1s time Unit Job of Process-2, so Process-2 has left 0s Time Unit JobAt Time 5s Doing 1s time Unit Job of Process-3, so Process-3 has left 0s Time Unit Job We can show the above thing as the following time-line Process-1 Process-1 Process-1 Process-2 Process-2 Process-3 0s 1s 2s 3s 4s 5s A shortened view of the above time-line is as follows,  | Process-1 |  Process-2 |  Process-3 | 0                 3 5 6 So now came the main thing, Waiting Time.
Ok, Look carefully, Process-2 Arrived at the List of Process at 1s with a Burst Time of 2s.
But CPU started processing Process-2 at 3s.

                    <text>So process-2 waited for 2s.
Process-1 Process-1 Process-1 Process-2 Process-2 Process-3 0s 1s 2s 3s 4s 5s But process-1 had not wait because it Arrived at 0s and also the CPU started processing it at 0s.
But Process-3 Arrived at the List of Process at 2s with a Burst Time of 1s.

                    <text>But CPU started processing Process-3 at 5s.
So process-3 waited for 3s.
Process-1 Process-1 Process-1 Process-2 Process-2 Process-3 0s 1s 2s 3s 4s 5s So total waiting time = (Waiting Time of Process-1)+ (Waiting Time of Process-2)                                      + (Waiting Time of Process-3)                                    = (0+2+3)s                                   = 5s So the average waiting time is = (Total waiting time / Number of Processes)s                                                  = (5/3)s                                                  = 1.66s Ok...I think you have understood the thing.

                    <text>Now lets talk about the program.
Input: You will ask the user for the number of processes.
Then for each process you will take its Process Number, Arrival Time and its Burst time.

                <section>
                    <text>You don’t have to worry, the number of processes wont be more than 5 or 6, Arrival time of a process can only be equal or greater than the arrival time of its previous process and Process will be entered as a serial number, so no problem.
Output: In the output you will have to print out the shortened time-line we showed you above.
For example, if the input is as follows, Arrival Process Burst Time 0 1 3 1 2 2 2 3 1 Then the shortened time-line will be,  | Process-1 |  Process-2 |  Process-3 | 0                 3 5 6 You can also print out the time-line vertically if you want (thats what I have done, see the output of my program) Ok beneath this shortened time-line you will have to print a table as follows, Process Arrival Finish Total Wait 1 0 2 3 0 2 1 4 2 2 3 2 5 1 3                                              Beneath this, you will have to show the Average Waiting Time.

                <section>
                    <text>I know you have understood, now see a screen-shot of exactly what I was talking about, Exception: One exception is that, I said “Arrival time of a process can only be equal or greater than the arrival time of its previous process&quot;.
So take a look at the following list of process, Arrival Process Burst Time 0 1 3 55 2 2 60 3 1 You see, the Job of Process-1 will complete at 2s, thus from 3s to 54s the CPU will remain idle.
Again the job of Process-2 will complete at 56s and thus from 57s to 59s the CPU will again remain as idle.

                    <text>You have to show this in the output and also notice that none of the processes has waited.
See the following screenshot, You can download my program (.exe only) to try it out.
Download from HERE .

                    <text>After you have written the program upload the .exe (not the code) and let me and others try it.
I am sure you will enjoy it.
However, this is the first program of Process Scheduling and the easiest one.

                    <text>* PARVEEN KUMAR February 7, 2013 at 7:30 AM In the program u should sort Arrival time so that your program will work even if i input in wrong order Reply Delete Replies * Tanmay Chakrabarty February 9, 2013 at 11:03 AM In this program, I wasn't in need to do that as in real case, the arrival time will never come unsorted.
However, thanks for suggestion.

                    <text>Diomidis Spinellis All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection ,&quot; is a famous quote attributed to Butler Lampson, the scientist who in 1972 envisioned the modern personal computer.
The quote rings in my head on various occasions: when I am forced to talk to a secretary instead of the person I wish to communicate with, when I first travel east to Frankfurt in order to finally fly west to Shanghai or Bangalore, and—yes—when I examine a complex system's source code.

                    <text>Let's start this particular journey by considering the problem of a typical operating system that supports disparate filesystem formats.
An operating system may use data residing on its native filesystem, a CD-ROM, or a USB stick.

                    <text>These storage devices may, in turn, employ different filesystem organizations: NTFS or ext3fs for a Windows or Linux native filesystem, ISO-9660 for the CD-ROM, and, often, the legacy FAT-32 filesystem for the USB stick.
Each filesystem uses different data structures for managing free space, for storing file metadata, and for organizing files into directories.
Therefore, each filesystem requires different code for each operation on a file (open, read, write, seek, close, delete, and so on).

                    <text>From Code to Pointers I grew up in an era where different computers more often than not had incompatible filesystems, forcing me to transfer data from one machine to another over serial links.
Therefore, the ability to read on my PC a flash card written on my camera never ceases to amaze me.
Let's consider how the operating system would structure the code for accessing the different filesystems.

                    <text>One approach would be to employ aswitch statement for each operation.
Consider as an example a hypothetical implementation of the read system call under the FreeBSD operating system.
Its kernel-side interface would look as follows:

                <section>
                    <text>int VOP_READ( struct vnode *vp, /* File to read from */ struct uio *uio, /* Buffer specification */ int ioflag, /* I/O-specific flags */ struct ucred *cred) /* User's credentials */ { /* Hypothetical implementation */ switch (vp-&gt;filesystem) { case FS_NTFS: /* NTFS-specific code */ case FS_ISO9660: /* ISO-9660-specific code */ case FS_FAT32: /* FAT-32-specific code */ /* [...] */ } }This approach would bundle together code for the various filesystems, limiting modularity.
Worse, adding support for a new filesystem type would require modifying the code of each system call implementation and recompiling the kernel.
Moreover, adding a processing step to all the operations of a filesystem (for example, the mapping of remote user credentials) would also require the error-prone modification of each operation with the same boilerplate code.

                    <text>As you might have guessed, our task at hand calls for some additional levels of indirection.
Consider how the FreeBSD operating system—a code base I admire for the maturity of its engineering—solves these problems.
Each filesystem defines the operations that it supports as functions and then initializes avop_vector structure with pointers to them.
Here are some fields of thevop_vector structure:

Note that although the completevop_vector structure contains 52 fields, only 16 are defined in the preceding code.

Then, in the FreeBSD kernel, the filesystem-independent part of the read system call implementation appears simply as (seeFigure 17-1, “Layers of indirection in the FreeBSD implementation of the read system call&quot;

Interestingly, FreeBSD also employs indirection to abstract the read function's arguments.

After some digging, I found that the kernel uses another level of indirection to layer filesystems on top of each other to an arbitrary depth.

                    <text>This layering allows a filesystem to offer some services (such as translucent views, compression, and encryption) based on the services of another underlying filesystem.
Two mechanisms work cleverly together to support this feature: one allows a single bypass function to modify the arguments of any vop_vector function, while another allows all undefined vop_vector functions to be redirected to the underlying filesystem layer.

The figure illustrates three file-systems layered on top of one another.
On top lies theumapfs filesystem, which the system administrator mounted in order to map user credentials.
This is valuable if the system where this particular disk was created used different user IDs.
For instance, the administrator might want user ID 1013 on the underlying filesystem to appear as user ID 5325.

                    <text>In the example shown in the figure, most system calls pass through a common bypass function in umapfs that maps the user credentials.
Only a few system calls, such asrename and getattr, have their own implementations in umapfs.
The ffs layer provides optimized implementations of read andwrite; both rely on a filesystem layout that is more efficient than the one employed byufs.

Thus, avop_default entry in the ffs vop_vector structure directs all those functions to call the underlyingufs implementations.
For example, aread system call will pass through umapfs_bypass andffs_read, whereas a rename call will pass through umapfs_rename and ufs_rename.

The vop_vector structure also contains a pointer to a bypass function.
This function gets the packed arguments and, after possibly performing some modifications on them (such as, perhaps, mapping user credentials from one administrative domain to another) passes control to the appropriate underlying function for the specific call through thea_desc field.

Unfortunately, in your case, the user and group identifiers on the remote system don't match those used on your computer.
However, by interposing aumapfs filesystem over the actual NFS implementation, we can specify through external files the correct user and group mappings.Figure 17-3, “Routing system calls through a bypass function&quot;

Another implementation detail, which we have not so far discussed and which can keep me awake at nights, concerns locking.

Furthermore, because obtaining and releasing locks can be expensive operations, ideally once a lock is held it should not be released if it will be needed again in short order.
These locking specifications can best be described through preconditions (what the state of a lock must be before entering a function) and postconditions (the state of the lock at a function's exit).

                    <text>As you can imagine, programming under those constraints and verifying the code's correctness can be hellishly complicated.
Fortunately for me, another level of indirection can be used to bring some sanity into the picture.
This indirection handles both the redundancy of packing code and the fragile locking requirements.

                    <text>In the FreeBSD kernel, the interface functions and data structures we've examined, such asVOP_READ_AP, VOP_READ_APV, and vop_read_desc, aren't directly written in C.
Instead, a domain-specific language is used to specify the types of each call's arguments and their locking pre- and postconditions.
Such an implementation style always raises my pulse, because the productivity boost it gives can be enormous.
Here is an excerpt from the read system call specification:

                    <text>The handling of locking assertions deserves more explanation.
For each argument, the code lists the state of its lock for three instances: when the function is entered, when the function exits successfully, and when the function exits with an error—an elegantly clear separation of concerns.
For example, the preceding specification of theread call indicated that the vp argument should be locked in all three cases.

The variants ending with av (readv, preadv) allow the specification of a vector of I/O requests instead of a single one.
Although I consider this proliferation of system calls inelegant and against the spirit of Unix, applications programmers seem to depend on them for squeezing every bit of performance out of the Web or database servers they implement.

It seems that indirection is everywhere we care to cast our eyes.
In the representative chunk we've looked at, nine levels of function calls, two indirections through function pointers, and a domain-specific language provided us with a representative view of its power.

Significantly, Wheeler completed his quote with another phrase: &quot;But that usually will create another problem.&quot;
Indeed, indirection and layering add space and time overhead, and can obstruct the code's comprehensibility.

                    <text>In fact, nowadays the tendency in modern programming languages is for some operations to always happen through a level of indirection in order to provide an additional measure of flexibility.
Thus, for example, in Java and C#, almost all accesses to objects go through one pointer indirection, to allow for automatic garbage collection.
Also, in Java, almost all calls to instance methods are dispatched through a lookup table, in order to allow inheriting classes to override a method at runtime.

In other cases, compilers optimize away the indirection we developers put in our code.
Thus, most compilers detect cases where calling a function is more expensive than substituting its code inline, and automatically perform this inlining.

                    <text>Then again, when we're operating at the edge of performance, indirection can be a burden.
One trick that developers trying to feed gigabit network interfaces use to speed up their code is to combine functionality of different levels of the network stack, collapsing some layers of abstraction.
But these are extreme cases.

                    <text>On the other hand, the effect that indirection has on the comprehensibility of our code is a very important concern, because over the last 50 years, in contrast to the dizzying increases in CPU speeds, the ability of humans to understand code hasn't improved much.
Therefore, the proponents of agile processes advise us to be especially wary when introducing layering to handle some vague, unspecified requirements we imagine might crop up in the future rather than today's concrete needs.
As Bart Smaalders quipped when discussing performance anti-patterns: &quot;Layers are for cakes, not for software.&quot;

This means that the lecturers assume that you have and use the book and that we assume that exercises in the book have been done.
The lectures will not just follow the book but provide additional points of view and background knowledge.

                    <text>  Examples will be taken from the book and from other literature and refer often to Linux and Windows.
In many cases we will also use POSIX, the portable operating systems interface.
For these examples we will use mainly C as the language.

In addition there are 2 hours of practical.
For the first block we also have 2 hours of instruction.
For the second block these are replaced by one hour of open consultation (‘vragenuur’).
In the first week we spend the time to get acquainted with the Linux operating system.

                    <text>   The purpose of the instructions is to discuss exercises from the book and from the site, and to provide you with information about the practical.
Typically, exercises and lecturing are somewhat mixed during the instruction sessions as indicated above.
Passing the course is through a final exam, a series of practical exercises for which a report has to be handed in and writing an essay on a research paper.

                    <text>  Examination There are two written exams, a practical and an essay.
The written exam will start with a collection of short knowledge oriented questions.
After that has been handed in, the book, and the slides may be used with the remainder of the exam.
It isnot allowed to use anything else, including copies of previous exams and solutions to exercises.
You will find example examinations plus solutions at the bottom of this page.

We list here some links that provide much more details on UNIX-related operating systems.

                    <text>In other words, a nonlinear system is any problem where the equation(s) to be solved cannot be written as alinear combination of the unknown variables or functions that appear in it (them).
It does not matter if nonlinear known functions appear in the equations; in particular, adifferential equation is linear if it is linear in the unknown function and its derivatives, even if non linear known functions appear as coefficients.

                    <text>Nonlinear problems are of interest to engineers , physicists and mathematicians because most physical systems are inherently nonlinear in nature.
Nonlinear equations are difficult to solve and give rise to interesting phenomena such aschaos .[1]
Some aspects of the weather (although not the climate ) are seen to be chaotic, where simple changes in one part of the system produce complex effects throughout.
A nonlinear system is notrandom .

Nonlinear algebraic equations Main article: Algebraic equation Main article: Systems of polynomial equations Nonlinear algebraic equations , which are also calledpolynomial equations , are defined by equating polynomials to zero.
For example, For a single polynomial equation, root-finding algorithms can be used to find solutions to the equation (i.e., sets of values for the variables that satisfy the equation).

It is even difficult to decide if a given algebraic system has complex solutions (seeHilbert's Nullstellensatz ).
Nevertheless, in the case of the systems with a finite number of complex solutions, thesesystems of polynomial equations are now well understood and efficient methods exist for solving them.[2]

Nonlinear differential equations A system of differential equations is said to be nonlinear if it is not alinear system .
Problems involving nonlinear differential equations are extremely diverse, and methods of solution or analysis are problem dependent.
Examples of nonlinear differential equations are theNavier–Stokes equations in fluid dynamics, theLotka–Volterra equations in biology.

It is often possible to find several very specific solutions to nonlinear equations, however the lack of asuperposition principle prevents the construction of new solutions.

The equation is nonlinear because it may be written as and the left-hand side of the equation is not a linear function of u and its derivatives.
Note that if theu2 term were replaced with u, the problem would be linear (theexponential decay problem).

Partial differential equations See also: List of nonlinear partial differential equations The most common basic approach to studying nonlinearpartial differential equations is to change the variables (or otherwise transform the problem) so that the resulting problem is simpler (possibly even linear).
Sometimes, the equation may be transformed into one or moreordinary differential equations , as seen in separation of variables , which is always useful whether or not the resulting ordinary differential equation(s) is solvable.

                    <text>Another common (though less mathematic) tactic, often seen in fluid and heat mechanics, is to usescale analysis to simplify a general, natural equation in a certain specificboundary value problem .
For example, the (very) nonlinearNavier-Stokes equations can be simplified into one linear partial differential equation in the case of transient, laminar, one dimensional flow in a circular pipe; the scale analysis provides conditions under which the flow is laminar and one dimensional and also yields the simplified equation.

                    <text>Illustration of a pendulum Linearizations of a pendulum A classic, extensively studied nonlinear problem is the dynamics of apendulum under influence ofgravity .
Using Lagrangian mechanics , it may be shown[ 3] that the motion of a pendulum can be described by thedimensionless nonlinear equation where gravity points &quot;downwards&quot; and is the angle the pendulum forms with its rest position, as shown in the figure at right.

                    <text>One approach to &quot;solving&quot; this equation is to use as an integrating factor , which would eventually yield which is an implicit solution involving an elliptic integral .
This &quot;solution&quot; generally does not have many uses because most of the nature of the solution is hidden in thenonelementary integral (nonelementary even if).

                    <text>Another way to approach the problem is to linearize any nonlinearities (the sine function term in this case) at the various points of interest through Taylor expansions .
For example, the linearization at, called the small angle approximation, is since for .
This is a simple harmonic oscillator corresponding to oscillations of the pendulum near the bottom of its path.
Another linearization would be at, corresponding to the pendulum being straight up:

                    <text>since for .
The solution to this problem involves hyperbolic sinusoids , and note that unlike the small angle approximation, this approximation is unstable, meaning that will usually grow without limit, though bounded solutions are possible.
This corresponds to the difficulty of balancing a pendulum upright, it is literally an unstable state.

                    <text>This corresponds to a free fall problem.
A very useful qualitative picture of the pendulum's dynamics may be obtained by piecing together such linearizations, as seen in the figure at right.
Other techniques may be used to find (exact)phase portraits and approximate periods.

In order to reduce the overhead involved in the polling process, a device requesting an interrupt may identify itself directly to the CPU.
Then, the CPU can immediately start executing the corresponding interrupt-service routine.
The term vectored interrupts refers to all interrupt-handling schemes base on this approach.

                    <text>In an aggressive implementation, which we explore later, the branch can be completed at the end of this stage, by storing the branch-target address into the PC, if the condition test yielded true.
Decoding is done in parallel with reading registers, which is possible because the register specifiers are at a fixed location in a RISC architecture.
Appendix A Pipelining: Basic and Intermediate Concepts This technique is known as fixed-field decoding.

                    <text>Note that we may read a register we don’t use, which doesn’t help but also doesn’t hurt performance.
(It does waste energy to read an unneeded register, and power-sensitive designs might avoid this.)
Because the immediate portion of an instruction is also located in an identical place, the sign-extended immediate is also calculated during this cycle in case it is needed.

Execution/’effective address cycle (EX): The ALU operates on the operands prepared in the prior cycle, performing one of three functions depending on the instruction type.
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Memory reference: The ALU adds the base register and the offset to form the effective address.

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Register-Immediate ALU instruction: The ALU performs the operation specified by the ALU opcode on the first value read from the register file and the sign-extended immediate.
In a load-store architecture the effective address and execution cycles can be combined into a single clock cycle, since no instruction needs to simultaneously calculate a data address and perform an operation on the data.

If it is a store, then the memory writes the data from the second register read from the register file using the effective address.
5. Write-back cycle (WB): Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Register-Register ALU instruction or Load instruction: Write the result into the register file, whether it comes from the memory system (for a load) or from the ALU (for an ALU instruction).

                    <text>Branch Target Buffer is the hardware that, in most cases, stores the target of a taken branches in the past.
Thus if the branch is encountered again and if the prediction is taken the address of the next instruction to be read is provided by the reading out the BTB.
Usually BTB is implemented as a fully associative cache.
Some BTB implementation also store the target instructions.

                    <text>Ans: The ideal throughput should be 1 instruction per clock cycle.
Dependencies and hazards like Data Hazard, Control Hazard and structural hazards prevent us from acheiving them.

                <section>
                    <text>Ans: There are several reasons for that: 1.
Since almost all the processors use branch prediction (which happens quite late in the pipeline say 30), if branch prediction comes out to be incorrect then processor has to flush all 29 instructions in pipe behind branch instruction which is a huge performance hit.

                    <text>2. 50 pipe statges would require registers after each stage and each register would have some latency.
So eventually the latency of each instruction increases (although throughput will increase)

                    <text>3. If you have 50 pipe stages, you are more likely to run it at a higher clock speed [because you are able to :)], you would end up having heating issues.
Faster the clock, hotter it gets….remember Pentium 4 Prescott :)

Can you know something about the engine that will make you a better driver (the horsepower, the torque curve)?

By understanding computer architecture you basically understand how everything is linked together, how a computer works and how come a program really does work; you see the big picture.

The other extreme also exists - where one is writing high performance code either in assembly or something that is compiled to native code (not running in a virtual machine).
In these extremes, one is concerned with what fits into the processor cache and how fast it is to access different parts of memory, which way the branch prediction on the processor goes (if the processor uses branch prediction at all or delay slots).

I will note, however that understanding processor cachescan be a part of programming on a managed platform.
Although in 99.99999% of the cases, it shouldn't. – parsifal Mar 27 at 16:06 @parsifal a most interesting example.

                    <text>Understanding concepts such as shared memory and inter-processor communication and the potential delays involved with these can help a programmer arrange their data and communicative methods to avoid relying heavily on these mechanisms, if needed.
This is true for other areas of programming such as horizontal scaling, where distribution and communication among a program or system of programs is a main focal point.

Simply throwing data into a communication queue and expecting it to scale is an undersight of what may really need to be put in place, especially if you must scale your software onto larger systems for better support.

In something like video graphics or maybe even physics calculations you wouldn't want to continually have an open communication with such a device; thus knowing this you would want to arrange this part of your program as such.

Functionality and good design will always trump performance unless performance isunusuable - and you don't need to know about cache efficiency to make 99% of apps 'usuable'. – Telastyn Mar 26 at 20:46 When I studied computer science (approx.

Apparently this is controversial, so I will elaborate.
Take the instruction set, a construct with a general form (operands, addressing modes, encoding) that is applicable to many different kinds of operations, such as arithmetic, logical, memory modification, and interrupt control.

The protocol would have the PIC sending nine-bit bytes, with no flow control.
I would display in my program's UI the values of the fields in the packets that the PIC sent.
Obvious question: how do I read the ninth bit of each byte?

I would read the value of the ninth bit according to the success or failure of the parity check.
Well, I implemented that, and it didn't work.
The values being displayed were obviously wrong.
And after three continuous days of researching PC UART architecture, I found out why.

                    <text>Here's why.
The PC UART buffers its input.
By the time it interrupts the CPU to say &quot;READY TO READ&quot;, any number of bytes could have accumulated in its buffer.
There is, however, only one Line Status Register to hold the value of the parity check.

                    <text>It is therefore impossible to tell which byte in the buffer failed the parity check.
So: make sure that the buffer is only one byte long, you say?
That's a flow control setting, and I already mentioned that this protocol didn't have flow control.
If I didn't know the architecture of the hardware I was programming, I would never have been able to say: &quot;Reading the ninth bit is impossible and needs to be cut.&quot;

                    <text>Even now as I play around with some Mesh Networking Idea's implementing the ZigBee spec, I've found that using the products and tools available (XBee ), I'm able to program inPython and plop the code right on chip (SoC) and do some really neat stuff with it..ALL without having to worry about anything to do with actual architecture of the chips, etc.. there are definitely hardware limitations to be cognitive of because of the chip size and the intended low price target.. but even THAT will become less in the upcoming years.So I stand by my &quot;Generally NO&quot; answer share |improve this answer edited Mar 27 at 17:32 answered Mar 26 at 22:02 hanzolo 1,604312 I think &quot;generally no&quot; is a good summary.
There are certainly fields of programming where it's as important as ever; but the bulk of professional programmers do not work in those fields. – Carson63000 Mar 26 at 22:16 2   &quot;There are certainly fields of programming where it's as important as ever&quot; Do any of those fields include programming in high level languages?
If yes, to be more specific, what is the case, to give an example? – Volkan İlbeyli Mar 26 at 22:25 @Volkanİlbeyli Programming in high level languages is just a means to an end.

                    <text>Many programmers who need to know this stuff for part of their job will also have use for some high level languages, if that was your question. – delnan Mar 26 at 22:28 2   I disagree.
We use some huge machine (32 cores 60G Memory and 3.3TB drives) ran as in a cluster of 400 machines.
But since are field is BigData even these machines are miniscule in terms of the data being processed.

The machine abilities may be doubling every 18 months but the data we are attempting to processes is doubling every 6 months. – Loki Astari Mar 26 at 22:48 1   -1.

You're willfully ignorant (and that is fine), as long as you don't set your sights too high.
If you want to truly become a &quot;good&quot; programmer, than you must make an effort understand the machines that you are commanding. – Stargazer712 Mar 27 at 1:42 show7 more comments up vote -4 down vote Learning computer architecture helps immensely in programming.

We want to be able to run apps on the device that may need more than 1M throughout their execution, although they never need more than 1M at any particular instant.

The block size is not enough to store a file.

Also a block whose unused bit is 0 doesnt point to anything and is not pointed to by any block.
Now u have an index of files with filename as index and the value as the first block in which the file starts.Lets says u somehow lose these indices and values.

                    <text>Prerequisites CIS501 is a graduate-level course on computer architecture that assumes significant prior knowledge of computer organization and architecture (do not be mislead by the word &quot;Introduction&quot; in the course title).
You should already be familiar with hardware caches, instruction execution pipelines, basic logic design, and some assembly-level programming.

                    <text>* What are the five stages in a DLX pipeline? * For a pipeline with ‘n’ stages, what’s the ideal throughput?
What prevents us from achieving this ideal throughput? * What are the different hazards?
How do you avoid them? * Instead of just 5-8 pipe stages why not have, say, a pipeline with 50 pipe stages? * What are Branch Prediction and Branch Target Buffers? * How do you handle precise exceptions or interrupts? * What is a cache? * What’s the difference between Write-Through and Write-Back Caches?

                    <text>Instruction fetch cycle (IF): Send the program counter (PC) to memory and fetch the current instruction from memory.
Update the PC to the next sequential PC by adding 4 (since each instruction is 4 bytes) to the PC.
2. Instruction decode/register fetch cycle (ID): Decode the instruction and read the registers corresponding to register source specifiers from the register file.

Sign-extend the offset field of the instruction in case it is needed.
Compute the possible branch target address by adding the sign-extended offset to the incremented PC.

                    <text>In an aggressive implementation, which we explore later, the branch can be completed at the end of this stage, by storing the branch-target address into the PC, if the condition test yielded true.
Decoding is done in parallel with reading registers, which is possible because the register specifiers are at a fixed location in a RISC architecture.
Appendix A Pipelining: Basic and Intermediate Concepts This technique is known as fixed-field decoding.

                    <text>Note that we may read a register we don’t use, which doesn’t help but also doesn’t hurt performance.
(It does waste energy to read an unneeded register, and power-sensitive designs might avoid this.)
Because the immediate portion of an instruction is also located in an identical place, the sign-extended immediate is also calculated during this cycle in case it is needed.

Execution/’effective address cycle (EX): The ALU operates on the operands prepared in the prior cycle, performing one of three functions depending on the instruction type.
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Memory reference: The ALU adds the base register and the offset to form the effective address.

                    <text>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Register-Register ALU instruction: The ALU performs the operation specified by the ALU opcode on the values read from the register file.
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Register-Immediate ALU instruction: The ALU performs the operation specified by the ALU opcode on the first value read from the register file and the sign-extended immediate.
In a load-store architecture the effective address and execution cycles can be combined into a single clock cycle, since no instruction needs to simultaneously calculate a data address and perform an operation on the data.

                    <text>4. Memory access (MEM): If the instruction is a load, memory does a read using the effective address computed in the previous cycle.
If it is a store, then the memory writes the data from the second register read from the register file using the effective address.
5. Write-back cycle (WB): Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Register-Register ALU instruction or Load instruction: Write the result into the register file, whether it comes from the memory system (for a load) or from the ALU (for an ALU instruction).

                    <text>Branch Target Buffer is the hardware that, in most cases, stores the target of a taken branches in the past.
Thus if the branch is encountered again and if the prediction is taken the address of the next instruction to be read is provided by the reading out the BTB.
Usually BTB is implemented as a fully associative cache.
Some BTB implementation also store the target instructions.

                <section>
                    <text>Ans: The ideal throughput should be 1 instruction per clock cycle.
Dependencies and hazards like Data Hazard, Control Hazard and structural hazards prevent us from acheiving them.

                    <text>Ans: There are several reasons for that: 1.
Since almost all the processors use branch prediction (which happens quite late in the pipeline say 30), if branch prediction comes out to be incorrect then processor has to flush all 29 instructions in pipe behind branch instruction which is a huge performance hit.

                    <text>2. 50 pipe statges would require registers after each stage and each register would have some latency.
So eventually the latency of each instruction increases (although throughput will increase)

                    <text>3. If you have 50 pipe stages, you are more likely to run it at a higher clock speed [because you are able to :)], you would end up having heating issues.
Faster the clock, hotter it gets….remember Pentium 4 Prescott :)

                    <text>There are situations, called hazards, that prevent the next instruction in the instruction stream from executing during its designated clock cycle.
Hazards reduce the performance from the ideal speedup gained by pipelining.

                    <text>How to Avoid Hazards: 1.
Structural Hazard: This arise when some functional unit is not fully pipelined.
Then the sequence of instructions using that unpipelined unit cannot proceed at the rate of one one per clock cycle.

                    <text>Another common way that it may appear is when some resources are not duplicated enough to allow all combination of instructional the pipeline to execute.
So by fully pipe lining the stages and duplicating resources will avoid structural pipeline.

One is the shallow cloning which you have just read in the first question.
In shallow copy only that object is cloned, any objects containing in that object is not cloned.

                    <text>For instance consider the figure ‘Deep cloning in action’ we have a customer class and we have an address class aggregated inside the customer class. ‘MemberWiseClone’ will only clone the customer class ‘ClsCustomer’ but not the ‘ClsAddress’ class.
So we added the ‘MemberWiseClone’ function in the address class also.

                    <text>Now when we call the ‘getClone’ function we call the parent cloning function and also the child cloning function, which leads to cloning of the complete object.
When the parent objects are cloned with their containing objects it’s called as deep cloning and when only the parent is clones its termed as shallow cloning.

It gives us a way to create new objects from the existing instance of the object.
In one sentence we clone the existing object with its data.

                    <text>By cloning any changes to the cloned object does not affect the original object value.
If you are thinking by just setting objects we can get a clone then you have mistaken it.
By setting one object to other object we set the reference of object BYREF.
So changing the new object also changed the original object.

Builder pattern helps us to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

                    <text>Builder pattern is useful when the construction of the object is very complex.
The main objective is to separate the construction of objects and their representations.
If we are able to separate the construction and representation, we can then get many representations from the same construction.

Abstract factory helps us to unite similar factory pattern classes in to one unified interface.
So basically all the common factory patterns now inherit from a common abstract factory class which unifies them in a common class.
All other things related to factory pattern remain same as discussed in the previous question.

So basically you have a problem context and the proposed solution for the same.
Design patterns existed in some or other form right from the inception stage of software development.

                    <text>Architecture and organization are independent; you can change the organization of a computer without changing its architecture.
For example, a 64-bit architecture can be internally organized as a true 64-bit machine or as a 16-bit machine that uses four cycles to handle 64-bit values.

                    <text>The difference between architecture and organization is best illustrated by a non-computer example.
Is the gear lever in a car part of its architecture or organization?
The architecture of a car is simple; it transports you from A to B.
The gear lever belongs to the car's organization because it implements the function of a car but is not part of that function (a car does not intrinsically need a gear lever).

                    <text>The concepts explained include some aspects of computer performance, cache design, and pipelining.  Examples, interactive applets, and some problems with solutions are used to illustrate basic ideas.
Most of the material has been developed from the text book as well as from &quot;Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach&quot; by the same authors.
The problems that have been solved have been taken from a number of sources, but the solutions are unique in the sense that emphasis has been placed not only on the answers but also on the reasoning processes that will help students solve similar problems.

                    <text>There are a variety of techniques for reducing the elapsed time to find one or all solutions to a consistent labelling problem.
In this paper we discuss and illustrate solutions consisting of special hardware to accomplish the required constraint propagation and an asynchronous network of intercommunicating computers to accomplish the tree search in parallel.

Data hazards Data hazards occur when instructions that exhibit data dependence , modify data in different stages of a pipeline.
Ignoring potential data hazards can result inrace conditions (sometimes known as race hazards).
There are three situations in which a data hazard can occur:

                    <text>(i2 tries to read a source before i1 writes to it) A read after write (RAW) data hazard refers to a situation where an instruction refers to a result that has not yet been calculated or retrieved.
This can occur because even though an instruction is executed after a previous instruction, the previous instruction has not been completely processed through the pipeline.

                    <text>i1.
R2 &lt;- R1 + R3 i2.
R4 &lt;- R2 + R3 The first instruction is calculating a value to be saved in register R2, and the second is going to use this value to compute a result for registerR4.
However, in apipeline , when we fetch the operands for the 2nd operation, the results from the first will not yet have been saved, and hence we have a data dependency.

Structural hazards A structural hazard occurs when a part of the processor's hardware is needed by two or more instructions at the same time.
A canonical example is a single memory unit that is accessed both in the fetch stage where an instruction is retrieved from memory, and the memory stage where data is written and/or read from memory.[3]

Eliminating hazards [edit ]
Generic [edit ]
Pipeline bubbling Main article: Bubble (computing) Bubbling the pipeline, also known as apipeline break or a pipeline stall, is a method for preventing data, structural, and branch hazards from occurring.
As instructions are fetched, control logic determines whether a hazard could/will occur.

                    <text>If this is true, then the control logic insertsNOPs into the pipeline.
Thus, before the next instruction (which would cause the hazard) is executed, the previous one will have had sufficient time to complete and prevent the hazard.

Register forwarding Forwarding involves feeding output data into a previous stage of the pipeline.
Forwarding is implemented by feeding back the output of an instruction into the previous stage(s) of the pipeline as soon as the output of that instruction is available.

Example NOTE: In the following examples, computed values are in bold, while Register numbers are not.
For instance, let's say we want to write the value 3 to register 1, (which already contains a 6), and then add 7 to register 1 and store the result in register 2, i.e.:

However, if Instruction 1 (write 3 to register 1) does not completely exit the pipeline before Instruction 2 starts execution, it means that Register 1 does not contain the value3 when Instruction 2 performs its addition.
In such an event, Instruction 2 adds7 to the old value of register 1 ( 6), and so register 2 would contain 13 instead, i.e.:

                    <text>Instruction 0: Register 1 = 6 Instruction 2: Register 2 = Register 1 + 7 = 13 Instruction 1: Register 1 =3 This error occurs because Instruction 2 reads Register 1 before Instruction 1 has committed/stored the result of its write operation to Register 1.
So when Instruction 2 is reading the contents of Register 1, register 1 still contains6, not 3.

                    <text>Forwarding (described below) helps correct such errors by depending on the fact that the output of Instruction 1 (which is3) can be used by subsequent instructionsbefore the value 3 is committed to/stored in Register 1.

                    <text>Forwarding applied to our example means that we do not wait to commit/store the output of Instruction 1 in Register 1 (in this example, the output is3) before making that output available to the subsequent instruction (in this case, Instruction 2).
The effect is that Instruction 2 uses the correct (the more recent) value of Register 1: the commit/store was made immediately and not pipelined.

                    <text>Unsourced material may bechallenged and removed .
(December 2007) In computer programming , indirection is the ability to reference something using a name, reference, or container instead of the value itself.

                    <text>The most common form of indirection is the act of manipulating a value through itsmemory address .
For example, accessing avariable through the use of a pointer .
A stored pointer that exists to provide a reference to an object by double indirection is called anindirection node.
In some older computer architectures, indirect words supported a variety of more-or-less complicatedaddressing modes .

                    <text>Delegation is another classic example of an indirection pattern.
Instrongly typed interpreted languages with dynamic datatypes , most variable references require a level of indirection: first the type of the variable is checked for safety, and then the pointer to the actual value is dereferenced and acted on.

                    <text>Recursive data types are usually implemented using indirection because otherwise if a value of a datatype can contain the entirety of another value of the same datatype, there is no limit to the size a value of this datatype could need.

                    <text>When doing symbolic programming from a formal mathematical specification the use of indirection can be quite helpful.
To start with a simple example the variablesx, y and z in an equation such as can refer to any number.
One could imagine objects for various numbers and thenx, y and z could point to the specific numbers being used for a particular problem.

                    <text>So to move on to a more significant example, in logic the formulaα can refer to any formula, so it could beβ, γ, δ, ... or η→π, ς ∨ σ,....
When set-builder notation is employed the statement Δ ={α} means the set of all formulae — so although the reference is to α there are two levels of indirection here, the first to the set of allα and then the second to a specific formula for each occurrence ofα in the set Δ.

Common units used in computer design include clock periods (cycles), seconds, Hz (hertz, cycles per second), and MHz (megahertz, millions of cycles per second). * Box your final answer so that it can be found quickly. * Number each problem.
The assigned order is preferred. * Number your pages using the notation m/n in the upper right corners of your engineering sheets, wherem is the number of the current page and n is the total number of pages in the current assignment.

                    <text>Homework Advice: DO NOT COPY HOMEWORK SOLUTIONS!
You will cheat only yourself if you do.
Many of the problems on the midterm and final exams will be very similar to exercises that have been assigned as homework.
If you do not attempt to solve the homework exercises yourself, you will be completely unprepared for the exams, and will be likely to fail the course.

These applications require the processing of large amounts of data in sophisticated ways.
For example: * Databases, data mining * Oil exploration * Web search engines, web based business services * Medical imaging and diagnosis * Pharmaceutical design * Financial and economic modeling * Management of national and multi-national corporations * Advanced graphics and virtual reality, particularly in the entertainment industry * Networked video and multi-media technologies * Collaborative work environments Overview Why Use Parallel Computing?

Parallel computers can be built from cheap, commodity components. * Solve larger problems: Many problems are so large and/or complex that it is impractical or impossible to solve them on a single computer, especially given limited computer memory.

Multiple computing resources can be doing many things simultaneously.
For example, the Access Grid (www.accessgrid.org ) provides a global collaboration network where people from around the world can meet and conduct work &quot;virtually&quot;. * Use of non-local resources: Using compute resources on a wide area network, or even the Internet when local compute resources are scarce.

Absolute limits are the speed of light (30 cm/nanosecond) and the transmission limit of copper wire (9 cm/nanosecond).

                    <text>Increasing speeds necessitate increasing proximity of processing elements. * Limits to miniaturization - processor technology is allowing an increasing number of transistors to be placed on a chip.
However, even with molecular or atomic-level components, a limit will be reached on how small components can be. * Economic limitations - it is increasingly expensive to make a single processor faster.
Using a larger number of moderately fast commodity processors to achieve the same (or better) performance is less expensive. * Current computer architectures are increasingly relying upon hardware level parallelism to improve performance: * Multiple execution units * Pipelined instructions * Multi-core Who and What?

Often implemented by establishing a synchronization point within an application where a task may not proceed further until another task(s) reaches the same or logically equivalent point.
Synchronization usually involves waiting by at least one task, and can therefore cause a parallel application's wall clock execution time to increase.

Cache coherent means if one processor updates a location in shared memory, all the other processors know about the update.
Cache coherency is accomplished at the hardware level.

                    <text>* Primary disadvantage is the lack of scalability between memory and CPUs.
Adding more CPUs can geometrically increases traffic on the shared memory-CPU path, and for cache coherent systems, geometrically increase traffic associated with cache/memory management. * Programmer responsibility for synchronization constructs that ensure &quot;correct&quot; access of global memory. * Expense: it becomes increasingly difficult and expensive to design and produce shared memory machines with ever increasing numbers of processors.

This saves the overhead associated with replicating a program's resources for each thread.
Each thread also benefits from a global memory view because it shares the memory space ofa.out.

However, there are several important caveats that apply to automatic parallelization: * Wrong results may be produced * Performance may actually degrade * Much less flexible than manual parallelization * Limited to a subset (mostly loops) of code * May actually not parallelize code if the analysis suggests there are inhibitors or the code is too complex * The remainder of this section applies to the manual method of developing parallel codes.

                    <text>Signal Processing An audio signal data set is passed through four distinct computational filters.
Each filter is a separate process.
The first segment of data must pass through the first filter before progressing to the second.
When it does, the second segment of data passes through the first filter.
By the time the fourth segment of data is in the first filter, all four tasks are busy.

Arrows represent exchanges of data between components during computation: the atmosphere model generates wind velocity data that are used by the ocean model, the ocean model generates sea surface temperature data that are used by the atmosphere model, and so on.

                    <text>* You DON'T need communications * Some types of problems can be decomposed and executed in parallel with virtually no need for tasks to share data.
For example, imagine an image processing operation where every pixel in a black and white image needs to have its color reversed.

                    <text>The image data can easily be distributed to multiple tasks that then act independently of each other to do their portion of the work. * These types of problems are often called embarrassingly parallel because they are so straight-forward.
Very little inter-task communication is required.

                    <text>* You DO need communications * Most parallel applications are not quite so simple, and do require tasks to share data with each other.
For example, a 3-D heat diffusion problem requires a task to know the temperatures calculated by the tasks that have neighboring data.
Changes to neighboring data has a direct effect on that task's data.

                    <text>* Cost of communications * Inter-task communication virtually always implies overhead. * Machine cycles and resources that could be used for computation are instead used to package and transmit data. * Communications frequently require some type of synchronization between tasks, which can result in tasks spending time &quot;waiting&quot; instead of doing work. * Competing communication traffic can saturate the available network bandwidth, further aggravating performance problems.

                    <text>* Latency vs. Bandwidth * latency is the time it takes to send a minimal (0 byte) message from point A to point B.
Commonly expressed as microseconds. * bandwidth is the amount of data that can be communicated per unit of time.
Commonly expressed as megabytes/sec or gigabytes/sec. * Sending many small messages can cause latency to dominate communication overheads.
Often it is more efficient to package small messages into a larger message, thus increasing the effective communications bandwidth.

The programmer may not even be able to know exactly how inter-task communications are being accomplished.

                    <text>* Synchronous vs. asynchronous communications * Synchronous communications require some type of &quot;handshaking&quot; between tasks that are sharing data.
This can be explicitly structured in code by the programmer, or it may happen at a lower level unknown to the programmer. * Synchronous communications are often referred to as blocking communications since other work must wait until the communications have completed. * Asynchronous communications allow tasks to transfer data independently from one another.

                    <text>For example, task 1 can prepare and send a message to task 2, and then immediately begin doing other work.
When task 2 actually receives the data doesn't matter. * Asynchronous communications are often referred to as non-blocking communications since other work can be done while the communications are taking place. * Interleaving computation with communication is the single greatest benefit for using asynchronous communications.

                    <text>* Scope of communications * Knowing which tasks must communicate with each other is critical during the design stage of a parallel code.
Both of the two scopings described below can be implemented synchronously or asynchronously. * Point-to-point - involves two tasks with one task acting as the sender/producer of data, and the other acting as the receiver/consumer. * Collective - involves data sharing between more than two tasks, which are often specified as being members in a common group, or collective.
Some common variations (there are more):

For example, before a task can perform a send operation, it must first receive an acknowledgment from the receiving task that it is OK to send. * Discussed previously in the Communications section.

                    <text>Designing Parallel Programs Load Balancing * Load balancing refers to the practice of distributing work among tasks so thatall tasks are kept busy all of the time.
It can be considered a minimization of task idle time.

For example, if all tasks are subject to a barrier synchronization point, the slowest task will determine the overall performance.

                    <text>* Equally partition the work each task receives * For array/matrix operations where each task performs similar work, evenly distribute the data set among the tasks. * For loop iterations where the work done in each iteration is similar, evenly distribute the iterations across the tasks. * If a heterogeneous mix of machines with varying performance characteristics are being used, be sure to use some type of performance analysis tool to detect any load imbalances.
Adjust work accordingly.

                    <text>* Use dynamic work assignment * Certain classes of problems result in load imbalances even if data is evenly distributed among tasks: * Sparse arrays - some tasks will have actual data to work on while others have mostly &quot;zeros&quot;. * Adaptive grid methods - some tasks may need to refine their mesh while others don't. * N-body simulations - where some particles may migrate to/from their original task domain to another task's; where the particles owned by some tasks require more work than those owned by other tasks. * When the amount of work each task will perform is intentionally variable, or is unable to be predicted, it may be helpful to use ascheduler - task pool approach.
As each task finishes its work, it queues to get a new piece of work. * It may become necessary to design an algorithm which detects and handles load imbalances as they occur dynamically within the code.

                    <text>* Description and objectives * Book and handouts * Topics * Slides * Hands-on exercises * Examination information * Related and other links Description When looking at future embedded systems and their design, especially (but not exclusively) in the multi-media domain, we observe several problems: * high performace (100 GOPS and far beyond) has to be combined with low power (many systems are mobile); * time-to-market (to get your design done) constantly reduces; * most embedded processing systems have to be extremely low cost; * the applications show more dynamic behavior (resulting in greatly varying quality and performance requirements); * more and more the implementer requires flexible and programmable solutions; * huge latencie gap between processors and memories; and * design productivity does not cope with the increasing design complexity.
In order to solve these problems we foresee the use of programmable multi-processor platforms, having an advanced memory hierarchy, this together with an advanced design trajectory.
These platforms may contain different processors, ranging from general purpose processors, to processors which are highly tuned for a specific application or application domain.

                    <text>This course treats several processor architectures, shows how to program and generate (compile) code for them, and compares their efficiency in terms of cost, power and performance.
Furthermore the tuning of processor architectures is treated.  Several advanced Multi-Processor Platforms, combining discussed processors, are treated.
A set of lab exercises complements the course.

                    <text>Purpose: This course aims at getting an understanding of the processor architectures which will be used in future multi-processor platforms, including their memory hierarchy, especially for the embedded domain.
Treated processors range from general purpose to highly optimized ones.
Tradeoffs will be made between performance, flexibility, programmability, energy consumption and cost.
It will be shown how to tune processors in various ways.

                    <text>Furthermore this course looks into the required design trajectory, concentrating on code generation, scheduling, and on efficient data management (exploiting the advanced memory hierarchy) for high performance and low power.
The student will learn how to apply a methodology for a step-wise (source code) transformation and mapping trajectory, going from an initial specification to an efficient and highly tuned implementation on a particular platform.
The final implementation can be an order of magnitude more efficient in terms of cost, power, and performance.

                    <text>In this course we treat different processor architectures: DSP (digital signal processors), VLIWs (very long instruction word, including Transport Triggered Architectures), ASIPs (application specific processors), and highly tuned, weakly programmable processors.
In all cases it is shown how to program these architectures.
Code generation techniques, especially for VLIWs, are treated, including methods to optimize code at source or assembly level.

                    <text>Furthermore the design of advanced data and instruction memory hierarchies will be detailed.
A methodology is discussed for the efficient use of the data memory hierarchy.
Most of the topics will be supplemented by hands-on exercises.

                    <text>In the past GPUs were very dedicated, not general programmable, and  could only be used to speedup graphics processing.
Today, they become more-and-more general purpose.
The latest GPUs of ATI and NVIDIA can be programmed in C and OpenCL.
For this lab we will use NVIDIA GPUs together with the CUDA (based on C) programming environment.

We added one extensive example program, about matrix multiplication, which demonstrates various GPU programming optimizations.
You will see getting something running using CUDA is not so difficult, but getting it efficiently running will take quite some effort.
After studying the example and learning material you have to perform your own assignment and hand in a small report.

                    <text>Hands-on 3: Exploiting the data memory hierarchy for high performance and low power In this exercise you are asked to optimize a C algorithm by using the discussed data management techniques.
This should result into an implementation which shows a much improved memory behavior.
This improves performance and energy consumption.
In this exercise we mainly concentrate on reducing energy consumption.
You need to download the following, and follow the instructions.

I didn't think that the Schaum's outline format would work for a subject like computer architecture, but it does.
All aspects of computer architecture are covered from computer arithmetic to processor design to memory systems to the advanced topic of multiprocessing.

                    <text>The format of the outline is a little different from the Schaum's usual formula.
Each chapter consists of an &quot;Objectives&quot; section, followed by an introduction, followed by the various subsections of that chapter.
There are examples and exercises on instruction set design, program design, block diagrams, and quite a few mathematical problems.

                    <text>This book is probably best suited to the advanced undergraduate or for self-study of the subject.
If you are a graduate student that is using Hennessy's &quot;Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach&quot; the level of difficulty of the mathematical problems in that book is not matched by this one, and you should look for another source.
Otherwise I recommend this guide for most students of computer architecture.

                    <text>Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element, typically acentral processing unit (CPU) and some form of memory .
The processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing and control unit that can change the order of operations based on stored information.
Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and the result of operations saved and retrieved.

                    <text>The first electronic digital computers were developed between 1940 and 1945 in the United Kingdom and United States.
Originally they were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modernpersonal computers (PCs).[1]
In this era mechanical analog computers were used for military applications.

                    <text>It referred to a person who carried out calculations, or computations, and the word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century.
From the end of the 19th century the word began to take on its more familiar meaning, a machine that carries out computations.[3]

                    <text>Limited-function early computers The history of the modern computer begins with two separate technologies, automated calculation and programmability.
However no single device can be identified as the earliest computer, partly because of the inconsistent application of that term.
A few devices are worth mentioning though, like some mechanical aids to computing, which were very successful and survived for centuries until the advent of theelectronic calculator , like the Sumerian abacus , designed around 2500 BC[4] of which a descendant won a speed competition against a modern desk calculating machine in Japan in 1946,[5] the slide rules , invented in the 1620s, which were carried on fiveApollo space missions, including to the moon[6] and arguably the astrolabe and the Antikythera mechanism , an ancient astronomical computer built by theGreeks around 80 BC.[7]

                    <text>The Greek mathematicianHero of Alexandria (c.
10–70 AD) built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10 minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums that might be considered to be a means of deciding which parts of the mechanism performed which actions and when.[8]
This is the essence of programmability.

Again in the 13th century, the monksAlbertus Magnus andRoger Bacon built talking androids without any further development (Albertus Magnus complained that he had wasted forty years of his life whenThomas Aquinas , terrified by his machine, destroyed it).[10]

The mechanical calculator was at the root of the development of computers in two separate ways.

Secondly, development of a low-costelectronic calculator , successor to the mechanical calculator, resulted in the development byIntel [17] of the first commercially availablemicroprocessor integrated circuit.

                    <text>First general-purpose computers In 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard made an improvement to the textile loom by introducing a series of punched paper cards as a template which allowed his loom to weave intricate patterns automatically.
The resulting Jacquard loom was an important step in the development of computers because the use of punched cards to define woven patterns can be viewed as an early, albeit limited, form of programmability.

It was only produced to order.Charles Babbage owned one of these portraits; it inspired him in using perforated cards in hisanalytical engine .[19]

                    <text>Limited finances and Babbage's inability to resist tinkering with the design meant that the device was never completed—nevertheless his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (themill) in 1888.
He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.
This machine was given to theScience museum in South Kensington in 1910.

                    <text>In the late 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the recording of data on a machine-readable medium.
Earlier uses of machine-readable media had been for control, not data. “After some initial trials withpaper tape , he settled on punched cards...&quot;[21]
To process these punched cards he invented thetabulator , and thekeypunch machines.

This design was first formally described byJohn von Neumann in the paper First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC , distributed in 1945.

TheElectronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC), completed a year after the SSEM at Cambridge University, was the first practical, non-experimental implementation of the stored-program design and was put to use immediately for research work at the university.
Shortly thereafter, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper—EDVAC —was completed but did not see full-time use for an additional two years.

The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can beprogrammed .
That is to say that some type ofinstructions (the program ) can be given to the computer, and it will process them.
Modern computers based on thevon Neumann architecture often have machine code in the form of animperative programming language .

A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second (gigaflops ) and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation.
Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams ofprogrammers years to write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors.

These instructions are read from the computer'smemory and are generally carried out (executed ) in the order they were given.
However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there.

                    <text>Comparatively, a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses.
But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time, with a near certainty of making a mistake.
On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions.
For example:

It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in about a millionth of a second.[32]

They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program, or have only subtle effects.
But in some cases, they may cause the program or the entire system to “hang ,&quot; becoming unresponsive to input such asmouse clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or tocrash .

Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer.
Since computers merely execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program's design.[33]

The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program, architecture.

Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember – amnemonic such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP.

They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud.
They are generally either translated intomachine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run, or translated directly at run time by aninterpreter .
Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.

It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer.
This is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and variousvideo game consoles .

Control systems in advanced computers may change the order of some instructions so as to improve performance.

Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program.
Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as “jumps&quot; and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples ofcontrol flow ).

                    <text>The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction, or might include multiplication, division, trigonometry functions such as sine, cosine, etc., andsquare roots .
Some can only operate on whole numbers (integers ) whilst others use floating point to represent real numbers , albeit with limited precision.

                    <text>However, any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform.
Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation—although it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation.
An ALU may also compare numbers and returnboolean truth values (true or false) depending on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other (“is 64 greater than 65?&quot;).

                    <text>In almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store binary numbers in groups of eight bits (called abyte ).
Each byte is able to represent 256 different numbers (2&lt;s&gt;8 = 256); either from 0 to 255 or −128 to +127.
To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight).

                    <text>Computer main memory comes in two principal varieties: random-access memory or RAM and read-only memory or ROM.
RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it.
ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions.
In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely.

It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.[42]

                    <text>If several programs are running “at the same time,&quot; then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time.
Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant.
This method of multitasking is sometimes termed “time-sharing&quot; since each program is allocated a “slice&quot; of time in turn.[46]

                    <text>Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks.
If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a “time slice&quot; until the event it is waiting for has occurred.
This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.

                    <text>Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and theWorld Wide Web , combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies likeEthernet and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous.
In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally.
A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. “Wireless&quot; networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.

                    <text>The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely versatile, distinguishing them fromcalculators .
The Church–Turing thesis is a mathematical statement of this versatility: any computer with aminimum capability (being Turing-complete) is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform.
Therefore any type of computer (netbook , supercomputer , cellular automaton , etc.) is able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage capacity.

                    <text>Misconceptions A computer does not need to be electronic , nor even have a processor , nor RAM , nor even a hard disk .
While popular usage of the word “computer&quot; is synonymous with a personal electronic computer, the modern[51] definition of a computer is literally “A device that computes, especially a programmable [usually] electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information.&quot;[52]
Any device which processes information qualifies as a computer, especially if the processing is purposeful.

                    <text>There is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology, such asoptical computers , DNA computers , neural computers , and quantum computers .
Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate anycomputable function , and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed.
However different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems; for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms (byquantum factoring ) very quickly.

Foreword,Irascible Genius, Charles Babbage, inventor by Maboth Moseley, 1964, London, Hutchinson * &lt;s&gt; In the proposal that Aiken gave IBM in 1937 while requesting funding for theHarvard Mark I we can read: “Few calculating machines have been designed strictly for application to scientific investigations, the notable exceptions being those of Charles Babbage and others who followed him ...
After abandoning the difference engine, Babbage devoted his energy to the design and construction of an analytical engine of far higher powers than the difference engine ...

This contrasts with very early commercial computers, which were often one-of-a-kind and totally incompatible with other computers. * &lt;s&gt; High level languages are also ofteninterpreted rather than compiled.
Interpreted languages are translated into machine code on the fly, while running, by another program called aninterpreter . * &lt;s&gt; The control unit's role in interpreting instructions has varied somewhat in the past.

All of the arithmetic-related instructions were passed on to its arithmetic unit and further decoded there. * &lt;s&gt; Instructions often occupy more than one memory address, therefore the program counter usually increases by the number of memory locations required to store one instruction. * &lt;s&gt; David J.
