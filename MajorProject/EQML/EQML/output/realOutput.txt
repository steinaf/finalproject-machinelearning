How will a retail point of sale system help me make more money?

Calvin Grimes, mobile product manager at Fiserv , sees mobile payments addressing a problem consumers don’t realize they even have.
Grimes notes it’s similar to how consumers used to think about mobile banking. “They didn’t realize they wanted it until they had it," says Grimes. “Leading financial institutions pioneered the service–now it’s expected."

We were told that our data could be transferred over to the new system (extra $), but then it couldn't.
We had to manually enter our 17,000 inventory items, customers, vendors, etc.
Retail Star assigns its own bar codes, so the actual bar code on the product has to be put in as an alias, as does the vendors part number.
I am sorry that so far I can't find anything about this system that makes life faster or easier.
Do you use RetailSTAR?

Some stores print and laminate mailing labels for use as customer identification cards.
If the label includes the customer's Retail Pro Customer ID in barcode, then a cashier can scan the barcode to quickly write the customer on a document or find the customer's record in the customer file Zip code lookup If you have set up your system to use ZIP/Postal Code Lookup, entering the ZIP code will automatically write the corresponding city, state, and/or country information on the customer record (see usage for the ZIP field described previously in the customer fields table).
If you enter a nine-digit zip code, such as 12345-6789, including the hyphen, the system will ignore the four-digit extension and look for an entry that matches the first five digits.

Lead times for items (if the item?s vendor has a lead time defined for it) are displayed on the Committed screen.
1. Select SYSTEM PREFERENCES > MERCHANDISE > VENDORS > USER-DEFINED > Text Field Names: Enter LT as the name for one of the text fields.
2. In the vendor module, enter the number of days of lead time for a particular vendor in the LT field.

* Gas stations * Beauty salons * Restaurants * Grocery stores * Liquor etc.
What really makes the POS software retail very unique is its ability to track and monitor the inventory for your specific business.
The retail software is known to complete several steps when an actual sale is processed, how?
It starts by immediately removing the sold item from the inventory database, and it also goes on to process the payment as well.

 Transform Any PC Into A Point Of Sale System Are You New To Retail Point Of Sales?

A Point Of Sale, or even more importantly, a Point of Service system, is a computer that is used instead of the old fashioned cash register.
It’s a personal computer (PC) connected to a receipt printer, cash drawer, credit/debit card reader and bar code scanner.

What can a POS system accomplish?

How much can I expect to pay?

How much will it cost me to train them?

Are all POS systems the same?
Can a system designed for a clothing store work in a hardware store?

In a grocery store we look at how many customers came into the store, filled or partially filled a basket and then abandoned it before they reached the Point of Sale.
Often, if this number of abandoned baskets is high it is a pretty strong indicator that our lineups were too long at POS and the customer got frustrated and left.
Now, this is not the reason for every abandoned basket, some are due to genuine emergencies that customers have (such as forgetting their wallets!).

Remember back a month ago, when Cook sent out a letter to customers admitting to the problem?
You know, the one where he sounded like he was groveling and where he said people can always use other map apps until Apple worked out the bugs?

Point-of-Sale Transactions In retail, the point-of-sale (POS) transactions are extremely important, yet have unique issues when compared to similar transactions in the B2B world.
An obvious question is: Why is the problem of a delay in issuing a small valued ticket (due to a hardware or software failure, or just slow response time) so critical?

The Numbers Behind SAP's Product Retailers are very motivated to get technology like this in place.
A recent Retail Systems Research study noted the "top 3 technologies reported by survey respondents were customer purchase analytics, CRM, and marketing operations planning" - right where SAP's new product lives.
And despite few problems collecting customer data, only 56% of the retailer respondents now believe they know who their best shoppers are, a big drop from last year's 73% figure.
