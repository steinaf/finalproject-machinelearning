                    <text>Answer: Not necessarily.
While there are many industry-specific software packages available, many of them don't offer all of the features available in a general retail software package.
Often times, a general retail software package can do everything that industry-specific software can do, plus a whole lot more.

                    <text>Add another $900 for each workstation.
Extended warranties can add $200 per year, but are worth it if your workstation ever goes down.
A top-of-the-line extended warranty will cost even more, but may be worth it if it's one that offers same-day delivery for a brand new, fully-configured workstation.

                    <text>Answer: The single biggest mistake retailers make when choosing a new retail POS system is buying the point of sale hardware before the retail software.

Choose a retail POS system that increases your speed of service with faster ticket entry, on-the-fly data entry, and data-driven lookups.

Choose a retail point of sale system that can readily accommodate additional users, additional workstations, and additional stores.
When considering your future growth, keep in mind features you may one day need, such as multi-currency support or support for multiple tax rates across different regions.
If history is a concern, make sure that the retail software you choose can store years and years of data.

                    <text>Answer: If you want your clerks to be able to process sales without a server, choose retail software with lane redundancy or an offline mode.
When point of sale workstations are 'offline' (i.e., not connected to the server), clerks can continue ringing up sales.
When the connection to the server is reestablished, data from the local workstation is synchronized or replicated with the data on the server.

                    <text>Answer: Yes.
When you purchase new retail software, you get the latest software release that's available on the date you purchase it.
As new features are added to the retail software in subsequent releases, only those users with active subscription services will receive those updates.
And no matter how good the retail software is, it may have a few bugs in it all.

Subscription services also encourage software companies to continue to invest resources in improving their retail software.

                    <text>Answer: No.
You should choose retail software with integrated ecommerce features.
With an integrated system, you can use one retail software package to manage both your web store and your brick-and-mortar stores.
An integrated ecommerce solution eliminates the extra effort and expense of maintaining inventory in multiple systems.

                    <text>Answer: Talk to more than one technology vendor.
Just talking to vendors doesn't cost a thing, and you'll learn a lot about retail software and point of sale systems in the process.
Don't just consider the retail POS systems available from each vendor.

                    <text>Answer: Whether you buy or lease a retail point of sale system depends on your budget.
Many technology vendors today offer flexible leasing options for retail POS systems, including 100% financing.
By leasing the retail software and/or the point of sale hardware, you can reduce the initial start-up costs associated with a new retail point of sale system.

The software carries the same features and online help-manuals as with an original RETAIL box set version.
AE and OEM can both be registered with the manufacturer, but receives no product support from the manufacturer (i.e. Microsoft, Corel, Lotus) because it is sold at a discounted price.

                    <text>A Retail Point of Sales system typically includes a computer, monitor, cash drawer, receipt printer, customer display and a barcode scanner, and the majority of retail POS systems also include a debit/credit card reader.
It can also include a weight scale, an integrated credit card processing connection and a customer pin pad device.
More and more POS monitors use touch-screen technology for ease of use and a computer is built in to the monitor chassis for what is referred to as an all-in-one unit.

                    <text>All-in-one POS units save valuable counter space for the retailer.
The POS system software can typically handle a myriad of customer based functions such as sales, returns, exchanges, layaways, gift cards, customer reward programs, BOGO (buy one get one), quantity discounts and much more.
POS software can also allow for functions such as date sensitive promotional sales, foreign currency handling and multiple payment types.

Computerizing your business does not necessarily give you an advantage over your competitors - you may have to do it simply to stay competitive.
Three areas where immediate benefits can be seen are:

                    <text>Computerizing the accounting functions will have a very small impact on your profitability but inventory is your number one asset.
Managing it well is a key factor to business success.
Good inventory control means balancing the expectations of your customers and your bankers, so you have to avoid being either under or over stocked.

This is because software that tries to do it all usually ends up doing some of it badly, and the few that don't are extremely expensive.

                    <text>No, it can be done much faster and more accurately if the POS system can read data from a hand-held barcode reader.
These units are carried to where the stock is and the counts are scanned or punched in.
The information is later transferred to the computer by cable.
The computer then pops up a table showing where the shelf counts do not match the computer data and gives you a chance to correct it quickly and easily.

                    <text>Good retail management software should print barcode labels in two sizes and can automatically print a label for every item in the last shipment.
Since the UPC barcode is industry assigned, you should use another barcode scheme for your own stock such as Code39.
There is no problem associated with having UPC and Code39 labels in the same store because barcode scanners can auto-recognise which type of label they are reading.

Which ones you use will depend on the nature and style of your business.
Better systems can limit the scope of a report to a given department, supplier, stock code range, etc.

However, this information is so valuable that not trying to gather it may be a mistake.
Experience shows that it costs a lot more to get a new customer into your store than getting an old one back.
This kind of marketing has proven to be the most cost-effective way to drive up sales.

It would be ideal to run the new system in tandem with the old one for a week or more, but this is a luxury that many stores cannot indulge in.

                    <text> Identifying your Niche Before you begin the process of sourcing your stock, it is always a good idea to visit a competitors store to see what they are stocking and what price levels they are retailing at.
Try to gain some idea of the brand names that are being sold and decide which seem to be the highest selling lines.
It is always a good idea to have a look in their reduction sections to get an idea of which items are not selling quite as well and are being sold off cheaply.

                    <text> It may be possible that the retailer will talk with you.
This is more easily achieved if they are some distance from your location and therefore not a retailer you will be in direct competition with.
If they will talk to you, attempt to get an idea from them of which items sell best and at which times of the year.

                    <text> Once you have established your product range, or at least a broad knowledge of a product range, it is time to search for the products.
It may be a good idea at this stage to visit some trade exhibitions or shows to broaden your own knowledge of the particular product range you have chosen.
You may find that newer versions of products are about to be released onto the market.

                    <text>Having this knowledge can help in two ways.
Firstly, it gives you an opportunity to source a new product range other retailers may not have discovered yet and secondly, you could use this information to your advantage and reduce your prices down for the stock that will be replaced with newer versions.
This can be done more gradually and with greater effect if it is carried out in advance of the new products arrival.

                    <text>Manufacturers - It can sometimes be beneficial to approach manufacturers directly.
Often they will sell directly to the retailer, but to do so the manufacturer will usually expect large bulk orders.
In some rare instances exclusivity can also be obtained which will ensure an extra possibility of success in your business.
If a manufacturer will not sell to you directly, then you should ask them for a list of their distributors.

There are often terms and conditions attached to certain sales, as with any purchase.

Always make sure though that if they do agree that this is written down clearly in the Terms and Conditions.

If we are to prove the saying true, we need to find out who the 20-percenters are and target our products directly at them.
The 20-percenters are the niche market and as a small retailer, you need to dominate these markets in order to make a healthy profit.

The next step is to figure out who’s trying to take your customers away from you.
It’s important to identify who will be in direct competition with you before you make a final decision about which niche market to jump into.
If you do this, you’ll be reducing risk, resources and expenses.

However, if you target a specific niche, for instance one particular style of orthopedic men’s dress shoes, the market segment becomes smaller and much easier to break into with a new product.

Niche markets can be finicky and they may only be able to support one company in that niche.
When pricing your product lower than your competitor, it’s important to be the first company that settles into this low-price area.
It’s also important to have secondary sources of service and product differences with your competitors.

                    <text>  3 - Staying On Top In An Economic Downturn    Small retailers, whether online or on Main Street, are often the first businesses to feel the effects of an economic downturn.
In many cases, a smaller retail business is unable to compete with the pricing that the larger big box department stores get, and customers are forced to buy at the lower prices of the big stores.

                    <text>   Customer Referrals The first thing a small retail business needs to do is get its customers involved in referring new clients in a bad economy.
Start giving out business cards to all of your customers with spaces on the back to write their name and contact information.
Have your customers hand those cards out to anyone they know to encourage those people to visit your store.

                    <text>The card offers a 10 percent discount to your new customers, and it pays your referring customer $10.
Word of mouth is one of the strongest forms of advertising, and a small cash reward can inspire your clients to start sending a slew of new customers your way.
Make sure that the card states that the 10 percent discount is only for the first order, and the $10 reward is only paid once for each new client.

One of the problems that people often encounter when shopping at a larger retail store is the lack of knowledgeable personnel available to assist customers with buying decisions.
A smaller retail store should take the time to educate the staff so that customers can be assisted immediately with accurate answers to product questions.

Stores that offer complimentary products can pool their resources and lower their individual advertising costs while maintaining their advertising presence.
For example, a record store can team up with a stereo store to work on advertising to help drive traffic to both locations.

I'm wishing I'd just done this through Steam, since I generally reformat my computer several times per year for hardware upgrades and whatnot.

BL1 would only let you buy the expansions through Steam if you had purchased the game FROM Steam.

In it, Gartner reported a striking 38 percent jump in mobile payment users from 2010 to 2011, to 141 million.
Even so, the report notes that the market has been slow to develop, and mass market adoption may be more than four years away.

                    <text>Calvin Grimes, mobile product manager at Fiserv , sees mobile payments addressing a problem consumers don’t realize they even have.
Grimes notes it’s similar to how consumers used to think about mobile banking. “They didn’t realize they wanted it until they had it,&quot; says Grimes. “Leading financial institutions pioneered the service–now it’s expected.&quot;

Those that do will benefit long-term, and attract enthusiasts eager to try this out in stores.&quot;

                    <text>The Basics What are mobile payments?
Mobile payments are monetary transactions facilitated through smartphones or other mobile devices, such as tablets.
These payments are initiated by a virtual wallet communicating with merchant payment terminals at the point of sale.

                <section>
                    <text>What is the consumer-facing technology behind mobile payments?
Consumers first register their credit card account with a virtual wallet application, such asGoogle Wallet or the soon-to-be-releasedISIS application .Capable mobile devices contain radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips that communicate with merchant terminals using a technology called near field communication (NFC).
The devices communicate when in close proximity, establishing a “contactless payment&quot; connection.

                    <text>What do retailers need to accept mobile payments?
Beyond the basic requirements to complete any credit card transaction (a merchant account, payment gateway, point of sale software, etc.), retailers must have either a standalone NFC-payment terminal or an integrated credit card machine that is ISO 14443-compatible.
Standalone receivers can be purchased for a few hundred dollars; fully-integrated credit card machines are more expensive.

                    <text>How do mobile payments benefit consumers versus using credit cards?
The simplicity of paying by phone–which consumers carry anyway–is one of its main selling points.
Theft prevention is also a benefit, as virtual wallets can be remotely wiped in the event a phone is lost or stolen.
Finally, value-added services built into virtual wallets–such as integrated loyalty programs and couponing–are some of the proposed future benefits of mobile payments.

                    <text>How much will a mobile payment transaction “cost?&quot;
Today, mobile payments via smartphones cost the same as using current NFC payment technologies such as PayPass and payWave.
Interchange rates are slightly higher for contactless payments than for traditional credit card payments although card companies could lower rates for NFC transactions like it did inItaly back in 2010.

                    <text>NFC signals transmit at a range of only a few centimeters (and a maximum of a few meters, in some instances), and virtual wallets require authentication to complete payments.
Applications with PIN passwords will inherently be safer than cards that are stolen and used elsewhere instantly.
Security technology experts are also researching new ways to increase mobile payment security–such as creating single-use credit card numbers to destroy the value of skimmed virtual wallets.

                    <text>The Merchant Opportunity How will mobile payments be integrated with couponing and loyalty?
Value-added services will undoubtedly drive consumer adoption of mobile payment platforms.
The smartphone will eventually link mobile payments with retail mobile shopping applications such asShopKick (which allows shoppers to earn points for mobile check-ins at participating stores),PunchTab (which rewards shoppers for purchases and for encouraging their social networks to shop at specific stores) andRedLaser (to scan QR and barcodes at stores for more product information), among others.

                    <text>For example, shoppers could check-in to specific store areas to receive targeted offers and immediately complete the sale; they could track their rewards points directly within their virtual wallet at the point of sale; or consumers could receive a coupon on their phone immediately after scanning a QR code or making a purchase.
The idea is that a mobile payment is the final step to completing a soup-to-nuts mobile shopping experience.

                    <text>Does point of sale technology selection have to change?
Most retailers will only have to update credit card terminals during their next upgrade cycle to offer mobile payment processing.
Other than that, most of the innovation will be within smartphone applications, not point-of-sale hardware or software.

For starters, retailers can stay on-top of payments in the news, as well as testing the waters with technologies such asGoogle Places .
Additionally, stay alert if your community is adopting NFC elsewhere, such as Boston’sNFC inniaitive within taxi cabs .

                    <text>TIP: Consider installing Snow Leopard on a separate partition (especially since Snow Leopard may need to do some reformatting of the partition it is being installed to).
With an OS installed on two partitions, you can then start up from either the Tiger partition or the Snow Leopard partition by pressing the Option Key during startup (or using the Start Up Disk preference in System Preferences).
This lets you keep you OS 10.4.11 installation in case you want to jump back.

Say yes to all for a smoother transition to Snow Leopard.
All settings, compatible apps/drivers and files will be copied to the new partition. …More * Answered by Ewald W from Vancouve * Mar 25, 2013 Recently Answered * what is the difference between mac os x 10.6 and mac os x 10.6 server?

                    <text>A: Yes.
Microsoft Retail Management System offers an application called Headquarters that allows retailers with a small chain of stores to centralize control of their Store Operations databases and reporting.
For instance, if you had six stores and a head office, you would have six licenses for Store Operations (each store with its own database) and one license for Headquarters at the head office.

For example, you will have the ability to export working reports into Microsoft Excel for further data analysis, or use Microsoft Word to do a mail merge of customer information stored in your new Microsoft Retail Management System database for targeted marketing campaigns.

                    <text>When Microsoft launches a new version of Windows, we will continue to allow OEMs to sell PCs preinstalled with the previous version for up to two years after the launch date of the new version.
Certain OEM versions ofWindows products include downgrade rights (as outlined within the software license terms).
Downgrade rights make it possible to use a previous version ofWindows instead of the licensed software preinstalled on a new PC.
SeeDowngrade rights for additional details.

                    <text>Answer A retail copy is one that you would buy in a typical store.
It usually comes with technical documentation, has less restrictive licensing, and costs more.
An OEM version costs less, has less documentation, and usually limits you in your ability to transfer the product from one computer to the other.

I seem to recall somewhere hearing that you can install it onto multiple computers without having to purchase a new license key.
How many computers are you allowed to install it on, before purchasing a new key?

This isn't a technical/software question about an OS.
It's a legal question about licensing. – Lord Torgamus Nov 9 '12 at 19:52 See superuser.com/questions/494782/… , specifically the part **without retaining any copies of the software. ** –  Hennes Nov 9 '12 at 21:12 4   @LordTorgamus We generally don't do legal questions, but practical questions about Windows licensing have always been welcome AFAICT. – slhck♦ Nov 9 '12 at 21:17 2 Answers active oldest votes up vote 12 down vote accepted (I Am Not A Lawyer.)

                    <text>– bjarkef Nov 29 '12 at 7:32 @bjarkef No, but you are breaking the EULA and if Microsoft was so inclined they could sue you and legally they are in the right so you would have to pay the copyright infringement fees do to your unauthorized copying of the software on to two machines simultaneously. – Scott Chamberlain Dec 10 '12 at 3:44 @ScottChamberlain: Actually, I live in Denmark, some years ago there was a court case regarding this, but relating to Windows XP I think.
The judge stated that the end-user (who where suing) could install Windows on as many of his computer as he wanted, as he was only a single person and could therefore only use one computer at a time.

So as long as Microsoft have not put in any technical limits, I will not hesitate to install my Windows copy on multiple computers. :) – bjarkef Dec 11 '12 at 10:24 @bjarkef There is no guarantee that Microsoft does not have a method to deactivate such installations - it's not exactly hard to detect.
And one reason we don't do legal discussions here (for the most part) is due to country specific legislation and precedent - all we will/can say is you are violating the EULA. – Bob Dec 11 '12 at 11:06 up vote 4 down vote The retail install disk only entitles you to a single installed instance of the software at any one time.

                    <text>Top What is COPPA?
COPPA, or the Child Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998, is a law in the United States requiring websites which can potentially collect information from minors under the age of 13 to have written parental consent or some other method of legal guardian acknowledgment, allowing the collection of personally identifiable information from a minor under the age of 13.
If you are unsure if this applies to you as someone trying to register or to the website you are trying to register on, contact legal counsel for assistance.

Ranks, which appear below your username, indicate the number of posts you have made or identify certain users, e.g. moderators and administrators.
In general, you cannot directly change the wording of any board ranks as they are set by the board administrator.
Please do not abuse the board by posting unnecessarily just to increase your rank.
Most boards will not tolerate this and the moderator or administrator will simply lower your post count.

                    <text>Usergroups are groups of users that divide the community into manageable sections board administrators can work with.
Each user can belong to several groups and each group can be assigned individual permissions.
This provides an easy way for administrators to change permissions for many users at once, such as changing moderator permissions or granting users access to a private forum.

The e-mail form feature of this board includes safeguards to try and track users who send such posts, so e-mail the board administrator with a full copy of the e-mail you received.
It is very important that this includes the headers that contain the details of the user that sent the e-mail.

                    <text>I've looked, researched and priced them and their competitors.
They are not only reasonable, but lower in most areas.
I am very proficient at IT work and do much of it for my Retail Store, yet I paid to have my systems professionally installed and have that peace of mind because this is my business.
They offer Training and Installation onsite as well as over the phone, you can save some money by doing it via the phone.

When one of my systems died, they were on the phone with us resolving it as best and as quickly as possible.
It's not their fault I have been running that specific system for the past 5 years without ever cleaning it or updating it, it's hardware - it doesn't last forever.
In fact 5 years, it paid for itself and ten-fold.

Thanks god I have the help of 2-3 highly trained IT people that work for this organization in other areas who have been able to help.
However, every time there is an upgrade to fix all of the current problems more problems are created.

Then came the time to network on two computers so naturally I signed up for their Retail STAR licensed version and forked over $2700.

                    <text>I endured this for a couple of years, paying $100 here a $150 there as and when stuff kept going wrong, having really got tired of this and needing to upgrade another of their super-duper shiny new now-everything-fixed versions, I forked over another $1800 for this so I get the upgrade and a yearlong support contract.
This version was so badly bug-ridden that I was on the phone at least once a week for weeks on end.
A few weeks before the end of my contract, I made sure I got another one of their now everything-fixed upgrades and still having problems related to the purchasing function, networking, data integrity etc. etc.

We were looking for a POS system that would save us time and money and keep track of our inventory.
We researched five different POS solutions and decided 6 years ago Retail STAR from CAM was the best choice.

I panicked, as I was not familiar with anything like that.
The CAM Installer/Trainer came on site and after 30 minutes we all were so familiar with the software that we could ring in our own sales without any assistance.
It was so easy to learn, and I really liked that you didn’t have to use a mouse to complete a sale.

Great company, Great support.
We began with their product Profits and used it for 14 years.
We upgraded to Retail Star and their integrated Credit Card Processing 6 years ago.
We were all hesitant about going to a new product because we aren’t very good with computers and it’s hard to “teach an old dog new tricks&quot;!!

It’s so easy to operate, handles our inventory beautifully, and as a Buyer I really get a lot of use out of Report Star.
I can use the existing reports or create my own with ease.
As a fashion store the inventory can be cumbersome.
I can buy a style in 14 colors and 10 sizes and Retail Star handles it with ease.

I would think that the high price of this package would include enough training to do simple tasks.
Receiving an order from a supplier is a good 2-hour ordeal, and we then have to spend more time to look up each item to see if the margin has changed.

If I want to look at an item, see what it cost, the price and margin, what I last paid, when my last purchases were, and how many I have sold and to whom, it takes a lot of time, many screens and custom reports.

We had to manually enter our 17,000 inventory items, customers, vendors, etc.
Retail Star assigns its own bar codes, so the actual bar code on the product has to be put in as an alias, as does the vendors part number.
I am sorry that so far I can't find anything about this system that makes life faster or easier.

                    <text>Regular File Reconstruction and maintenance It is recommended that you make automated file reconstruction a routine part of your Retail Pro database management.
File reconstruction can be performed automatically using the Retail Pro Scheduler.
(Refer to Retail Pro Tool Supplement #8: The Scheduler.)
You can schedule reconstruction of individual files or a group of files specified by a file list.

                    <text>Equipment Maintenance 1.
Never turn your computer off with the power switch until Windows has shut down.
The one exception to this rule is when your computer locks up and your hard drive is not running (hard drive light is not blinking).
In this situation, you can turn the power off without harmful effects to the hard drive.
As cutting the power can also result in lost data or Windows files, you should only do this when you have to.

A UPS with line conditioner is preferred.
This will keep your computer from crashing during power outages, and will protect your computer from low and high voltage occurrences.
An UPS is far superior to a surge protector and will save your computer from almost any power type of disaster.

Change the mode to Full Reconstruct and select Start to reprocess those remaining files.

                    <text>Both the lookup number and the quantity scanned are temporarily stored in the portable unit and later transmitted to the computer running Retail Pro via a cable attached to a serial port.
The reader only needs to be connected to the computer during the transmission.
This is extremely convenient, especially when taking physical inventory or scanning received items to make a voucher.

                    <text>Deleting Manually vs. &quot;Cleaning House&quot; Although you can manually delete items from inventory, it is usually better to use Clean House to erase items that are no longer needed.
Clean House prevents you from deleting out-of-stock items that are committed on a PO, SO, or TO, or that have a non-zero company on-hand quantity.
When Clean House erases an item from inventory, it also clears the entries for that row from a number of inventory-related files, making the row ready to use for a new item.

When you sort by a column heading, only the records that have an entry in that column will be displayed.
This can make it appear that many of your records have disappeared, when in fact they are simply not being displayed.
To display all fields again, sort by a column heading, such as Item #, that has an entry for all records.

                    <text>Tip: Faster List View Displays In large data files, List View will display fastest when record number is used as the sort column (Item # in inventory, document number in document areas, etc.).
This is because the records are stored in that order in the data files.
When sorting by other columns, the program must scan the entire file and reorder the records accordingly.
It is recommended you normally sort by record number, switching to another column only when needed to search for a specific record.

                    <text>Point of Sale Tips Recording Tax-Exempt Sales A good way to handle tax exempt sales is to predefine a tax area with a 0% tax rate and then select that tax area when making a tax-exempt receipt.
Using this method allows you to report tax-exempt sales by filtering on the defined 0% tax area.
If you have tax-exempt customers, assign them the tax area with 0% tax in the customer file to insure their purchases are automatically recorded with no tax.

In this way, you can enter the jackpot item on the receipt, edit its price and description as needed, and update.
The non-inventory flag means the quantity on-hand in inventory will always be shown as zero, and the item will not show up in on-hand item reports.
The fees listed this way will be reported as normal sales on reports.

                    <text>Customer Discounts Cancel Previous Document Discounts Adding a customer with an assigned customer discount to a document that already has discounts applied (whether to individual items or a global discount) results in the cancellation of the other discounts.
For example, let's say customer James Johnson has a 10% customer discount assigned, and he purchases an item that is 15% off.

                    <text>If you first list the item on the receipt, THEN add Johnson as the Bill To customer, the 15% item discount will be overwritten by Johnson's 10% customer discount.
On the other hand, if you list Johnson on the document first, and then list the item, the item discount will be applied, overwriting the assigned customer discount.

What really makes the POS software retail very unique is its ability to track and monitor the inventory for your specific business.
The retail software is known to complete several steps when an actual sale is processed, how?
It starts by immediately removing the sold item from the inventory database, and it also goes on to process the payment as well.

At the end of the business day, the software retail then backs up all the transactions for the day and also makes an immediate electronic deposit to the business' bank account.

                    <text>Software developers seem to be herd animals.
They like to stay very close to each other.
As a result, the marketplace ends up riddled withhundreds of ToDo lists while other segments are deserted, despite high financial stakes.
During my routine browsing of software business forums, I have noticed that the most common answer toWhy the heck are you producing yet another ToDo list? is the desperately annoyingBecause I can’t find a better idea.

                    <text>This is desperately annoying because the world is full (saturated even) with problems so painful that people or companies would be very willing to pay to relieve the pain, even if only a little.
A tiny fraction of these problems are addressed by the software industry (such as the need for ToDo lists), but most are just lacking any decent solution.

                    <text>Hence, I detail below 3 low-competition software niches in retail.
Indeed, after half a decade of runningsales forecasting software company Lokad , I believe, despite the potential survivor bias , that I have acquired insights on a few B2B markets close to my own.
Firstly I will address a few inevitable questions:

                <section>
                    <text>Q: If you have uncovered such profitable niches, why don’t you take over them yourself?
A: Mostly because running a growing business already takes about 100% of my management bandwidth.

A: Odds are extremely low on that one.
The herd instinct is just too strong.

                    <text>Q.
Do I have to pay you if I use one of your ideas?
A. No, I am releasing this into the public domain.
I expect no payment if you get rich (unless you want to!) and accept no liability if you fail miserably.
Execution is everything.  And don’t trust a random stranger on the Internet – do your own market research.

                    <text>Before digging into the specifics of those niches, here are a couple of signs that I have noticed to be indicators of desperate lack of competition:

                    <text>* No one bothers about doing even basic SEO. * No prices on display. * No one offers self-signup – you have to go through a sales rep. * Little in the way of online documentation or screenshots are available.
However,lack of competition does not mean lack of competitors.
It’s just not the sort of competition that keeps you up at night.
Through private one-to-one discussions with clients of those solutions, here is the typical feedback I get:

                    <text>* Licenses are hideously expensive. * Setup takes months. * Upgrade takes months (and is hideously expensive). * Every single feature feels half-baked.
By way of anecdotal evidence – during a manufacturer integration with our forecasting technology a few months ago at Lokad, we discovered that the client had been charged $2,000 by its primary software provider in order to activate Remote Desktop on the Windows Server where the software was installed.
Apparently, this was well within the norm of their usual fees for the inventory management system in place.

                <section>
                    <text>Granted, just being cheaper is usually not a good place to be in the market.
Yet, when a competitor’s software is designed in such a way that it takes a small army of consultants to get it up and running, they can’t just lower their license fees to match yours – assuming that your design is not half-baked too.
The competition would have to redesign their solution from scratch, and give up on their consultingware revenues.
So you are in a great position todrive competition crazy .

                    <text>With a market managing over two-thirds of the US gross domestic product , one would expected retail be saturated by fantastic software products.
It turns out this is not the case.
Not by a long shot – except eCommerce (e.g. online shopping carts) which attracts azillion developers for no good reason.

                    <text>* Most retailers are already equipped in basic stuff such as point-of-sale, inventory management and order management systems.
So you don’t have to deliver that yourself.
On the contrary, you should rely on the assumption that such software is already in place. * As far the Lokad experience goes with its online sales forecasting service, retailers are not unwilling to disclose their data to a 3rd party over the Internet.

                    <text>It takes trust and trust takes time.
Interestingly enough, at Lokad we do sign NDAs, but rather infrequently.
We are not unwilling, but most retailers (even top 100 worldwide ones) simply don’t even bother. * Retailers have a LOT of data, and yet unlike banks, they have little talented manpower to deal with it.
Many retail businesses are highly profitable though and could afford to pay for this kind of manpower, but as far I can tell, it’s just not part of the usual Western retail culture.

Niche 1: EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) calculator Retailers know they need to keep their stocks as low as possible, while preserving their service levels (aka rate of non stock-outs), see thissafety stock tutorial for more details.
If the marginal ordering cost for replenishment was zero, then retailers would produce myriads of incremental replenishment orders, precisely matching their own sales.
This is not the case.

                    <text>One century ago, F.
W. Harris introduced the economic order quantity (EOQ) which represents the optimal quantity to be ordered at once by the retailer, when friction factors such as the shipping cost are taken into account.
Obviously, the Wilson Formula (see Wikipedia for details) is an extremely early attempt at addressing the question.
It’s not too hard to see that many factors are not accounted for, such as non-flat shipping costs, volume discounts, obsolescence risks …etc.

                <section>
                    <text>Picking the right quantity to order is obviously a fundamental question for each retailer performing an inventory replenishment operation.
Yet, AFAIK, there is no satisfying solution available on the market.ERP systems just graciously let the retailer manually enter the EOQ along with other product settings.
Naturally, this process is extremely tedious, firstly because of the sheer number of products, secondly because whenever a supply parameter is changing, the retailer has to go through all the relevant products all over again.

Pricing guestimate: Charge by the number of products rather than by the number of users.
I would suggest to start around $50/month for small shops and go up to $10k/month for large retail networks.

                <section>
                    <text>Gut feeling: EOQ seemingly involves a lot of expert knowledge (my take: acquiring this knowledge is a matter of months, not years).
So there is an opportunity to position yourself as an expert here, which is a good place to be as it facilitates inbound marketing and PR with specialized press.
Also, EOQ can be narrowed down to sub-verticals in retail (e.g. textiles) in case competition grows stronger.

                    <text>Niche 2: Supplier scorecard manager For a retailer, there are about 3 qualities that define a good supplier: lowest prices, shortest shipment delays, best availability levels (aka no items out-of-stock delaying the shipments).
Better, sometime exclusive, suppliers give a strong competitive edge to a retailer.

If the cheapest supplier doesn’t deliver half of the time, “savings&quot; will turn into very expensivelost sales.
As far I can observe, beyond pricing, assessing quality of the suppliers is hard, and most retailers suffer an ongoing struggle with this issue.

                    <text>An idea that frequently comes to the mind of retailers is to establish contracts with suppliers that involve financial penalties if delays or availability levels are not enforced.
In practice, the idea is often impractical.
Firstly, you need to be Walmart-strong to inflict any punitive damage on your suppliers without simply losing them.
Secondly, shipping delays and availabilities needs to be accurately monitored, which is typically not the case.

                    <text>A much better alternative, yet infrequently implemented outside the large retail networks, consists of establishing a supplier scorecard based on the precise measuring of both lead times (i.e. the duration between the initial order and the final delivery) and of the item availability.
The scorecard is a synthetic, typically 1-page, document refreshed every week or every month that provides the overall performance of each supplier.

Globally, the software market is swarming with hundreds of sales analytics tools, most of them being distant competitors of Business Objects acquired by SAP years ago.
However, the business model of most retailers is extremely simple and straightforward, making all those Business Intelligence tools vast overkill for small and medium retail networks.

Then, being razor-sharp in a market where very little online content is available, offers you a cheap opportunity at doing some basic SEO based on the very specific questions your software is addressing.

Don’t even bother about providing a super-complicated setup wizard.
Just offer a $2k to $5k setup package that includes the ad-hoc handful of SQL lines to match the existing data of the retailer.
We are already using this approach at Lokad withSalescast .
Alternatively, we also offer anintermediate SQL schema , if the retailer is willing to deal with the data formatting on its own.

What do you think of the argument that enterprise software needs to be either: 1.
Cheap and shrink-wrapped, &lt;$1000 and without any handholding in the sales or setup process OR 2. $50k+, with an in-person sales process with no profitable space between these two price points.

His only attempt with StackExchange certainly does not like a big success as far his B2B wannabe clients are concerned http://vermorel.com/journal/2010/4/17/stack-exchange-20-epic-fail.html Back to the pricing point, first I know dozens of counter example to this statement.

There are many in-between, the amount of dedicated personal attention growing with the pricing.

After 10min on your website, I am still having hard time to figure out what “Haystack&quot; is supposed to be doing.
Then, as far I can tell, it’s completely unfocused on retail: two case studies are manufacturing companies.

No - No prices on display. =&gt; Does Haystack expose a public price?

Then, you can’t expect retailers to come back to you with expect advices!
At Lokad, we certainly don’t expect our clients to improve our statistical forecasting algorithms… Second, you need to get marketing basics right, why would any retailer in their right mind purchase a product with only 29 words of description!

Retailers won’t find you because of the EOQ keyword, they will find you because you’ve got retail-specific SEO strategy with many supply chain related content.
Pine-Groove has none.
Worse, your calculators are branded as *financial*, why is like saying “This product is NOT relevant for supply chain&quot;.

A stand-alone calculator has a usefulness close to zero: the retailer is not going to re-enter manually a dozen of parameters each time she is making an order!
The calculator needs to be seamlessly integrated with the ERP – which did not exist in the 80s for most retailers.

We’ve noticed that owners and line managers seldom can articulate real from wishes, but the non verbal feedback is often surprising and, more often than not, rewarding.

Perhaps the potential cost savings of a detailed calculation is not large enough to warrant the extra effort/cost of a detailed EOQ calculation?
Or maybe organizational boundries make it too hard to get quality input of the different factors?

                    <text>Bien cordialement * 18 Joannes Vermorel 17 July 2011 at 6:54 pm Hi Ron, Sometimes, it takes years to spot the obvious.
It took me about 6 years to realize the OOS (Out-Of-Shelf) optimization was a much desired app for retailers, and that OOS optimization was primarily relying on good forecasts, see http://blog.lokad.com/journal/2011/6/19/shelfcheck-on-shelf-availability-optimizer-announced.html I am guessing that EOQ is the same sort of problem that you can ignore for years even while working on an inventory management system.

                    <text>As far pricing goes, if you app can save more than a few hours per user per month, then you can price $100 / user / month.
Then, your mileage may vary depending on the added value of your app, beyond saving time.
If it does save money too (smarter purchases), then added-value is much higher (and so can be the price).

                    <text>* With Retail Returns Management, Oracle is tackling the growing problem of fraudulent returns, which cost retailers about $9.6 billion per year, according to the National Retail Federation.
Oracle says the software lets users accurately process returns across all stores through real-time return authorizations that screen for fraud by analyzing return behavior and identifying specific return patterns.
The goal, said Sean Ford, Oracle's vice president of retail marketing, is to detect and deter criminals who take advantage of return polices to launder money, return used items and receive cash for stolen goods.

                    <text>Oracle Returns Management is unique because users can put highly dynamic return policies in place, Baird said.
For instance, a company's biggest customer might also be the one who returns the most items, so it's probably not a good idea to hold that customer to the same return policies as most.

                    <text>&quot;I don't know anybody else who has that particular facet of their return policy management solution,&quot; Baird said.
&quot;They're taking stuff that's happening at point-of-sale and they're marrying it against customer tracking information within their loyalty application.&quot;

                    <text>Ford said Oracle Retail Promotion Planning and Optimization combines planning, forecasting and analytics to help retailers profit more from special sales and promotions.
It does so by analyzing the drivers of customer demand and the effectiveness of past promotions, he said.

                    <text>Even if the U.S. audience is more receptive to Oracle, the company still has its work cut out for it in terms of getting retailers to adopt new technology.
Historically, Baird said, retailers have lagged behind other industries in the adoption of new technologies -- especially when it comes to things like enterprise resource planning (ERP) and integrated software suites.

                    <text>&quot;I think in general, technology resources in the retail industry are a little more educated about what kinds of commitments you have to make if you're going to go down an ERP or a retail suite path,&quot; Baird said.
&quot;They're thinking about it, but they haven't started acting on it yet.&quot;

                    <text>Answer: Not necessarily.
While there are many industry-specific software packages available, many of them don't offer all of the features available in a general retail software package.
Often times, a general retail software package can do everything that industry-specific software can do, plus a whole lot more.

Extended warranties can add $200 per year, but are worth it if your workstation ever goes down.
A top-of-the-line extended warranty will cost even more, but may be worth it if it's one that offers same-day delivery for a brand new, fully-configured workstation.

                    <text>Answer: The single biggest mistake retailers make when choosing a new retail POS system is buying the point of sale hardware before the retail software.
The retail software you choose to run your retail business may not be compatible with your new point of sale hardware.

Buying both the point of sale hardware and the retail software from the same vendor can reduce or eliminate compatibility issues and can often reduce your overall technology costs.

Instead of using separate systems for your retail, mail order, ecommerce, and wholesale divisions, choose one retail software package that can manage your entire business.
Choose a retail POS system that increases your speed of service with faster ticket entry, on-the-fly data entry, and data-driven lookups.

                <section>
                    <text>Answer: A scalable retail software package will grow with you as your business grows.
Choose a retail point of sale system that can readily accommodate additional users, additional workstations, and additional stores.
When considering your future growth, keep in mind features you may one day need, such as multi-currency support or support for multiple tax rates across different regions.
If history is a concern, make sure that the retail software you choose can store years and years of data.

                    <text>Answer: If you want your clerks to be able to process sales without a server, choose retail software with lane redundancy or an offline mode.
When point of sale workstations are 'offline' (i.e., not connected to the server), clerks can continue ringing up sales.
When the connection to the server is reestablished, data from the local workstation is synchronized or replicated with the data on the server.

When you purchase new retail software, you get the latest software release that's available on the date you purchase it.
As new features are added to the retail software in subsequent releases, only those users with active subscription services will receive those updates.
And no matter how good the retail software is, it may have a few bugs in it all.

                    <text>Answer: Talk to more than one technology vendor.
Just talking to vendors doesn't cost a thing, and you'll learn a lot about retail software and point of sale systems in the process.
Don't just consider the retail POS systems available from each vendor.

                    <text>You also need to consider the vendor's location, areas of expertise, and number of years in business.
Does the vendor offer extended support hours if you need them?
If you have stores in multiple regions, can your vendor support all of your stores?
Make sure that the vendor you choose can grow with you as your business grows.

                <section>
                    <text>Answer: Whether you buy or lease a retail point of sale system depends on your budget.
Many technology vendors today offer flexible leasing options for retail POS systems, including 100% financing.
By leasing the retail software and/or the point of sale hardware, you can reduce the initial start-up costs associated with a new retail point of sale system.

The software carries the same features and online help-manuals as with an original RETAIL box set version.
AE and OEM can both be registered with the manufacturer, but receives no product support from the manufacturer (i.e. Microsoft, Corel, Lotus) because it is sold at a discounted price.

                    <text>Revised: September 23, 2005 Contact Information Excel Merging Problems With Retail POS Software Maid * Home * Resellers * Contact Us Shopping cart - empty. * Retail Software * Restaurant software * Salon software * POS Hardware * Support POS Maid Software Excel Merging Problems There are two common reasons of why this area would be a problem for a user:   A) Even though our retail software totally accommodates the transfer of the data from an Excel table, the software MS Excel 2000 or newer version is required to be installed on the given PC  for the transfer purposes (after the transfer is completed it is no longer required).
So do you have the program MS Excel 2000 or newer version on your PC?  
B) Most of the problems we had so far regarding this area of the software are almost always cases where customers do not get the format of the Excel table right.

                    <text>Avoiding the Ten Most Common Mistakes in Retail Technology One of the most frightening purchases that a retailer ever makes is their technology.
The reason for this is that unlike inventory, which hopefully will sell in the next few weeks or months, the technology investment is for years.
A mistake in inventory is often remedied by a series of markdowns.
A mistake in technology can sometimes be remedied by bankruptcy court.
For this reason, retailers have to be very careful of what they invest in.

The mistakes are not in order of magnitude, but any one could ruin a store.

                    <text>1. Little or No Staff Training Often, the single biggest mistake retailers make when implementing technology is to dismiss the importance of staff training.
A store can have the very best software, but if no one understands it or knows how to use it properly, it could put a store out of business.

                    <text>It is very important that money be budgeted for both hardware and software training.
While it is true that sufficient training can cost up to eight times what is spent on software, minimum training exposes the retailer to more risk.
This risk translates into frustrated customers, inadequate inventories, discontented sales people and ineffectual support staff.
Therefore to reduce the risk, training expenditures must be increased.

At this stage, training schedules should be created.
During this pre-install time, the decisions on department/class should also be made.
This session may take anywhere from half a day to five days, depending on the size of the retailer.

The solution is to prepare a detailed needs analysis that includes every aspect of the store operations.
This makes it easier to quantify benefits and cost-justify expenditures.

The faster and more accurate the scanner, the more time you will save at POS. * Join into a Maintenance Repair Contract that provides ‘tune-ups’ for the equipment at regular intervals.
Establish one-day service or even one- or two-hour service for repairs and don’t let maintenance contracts lapse.

However, do not use a virus scan that is memory resident as it can cause more problems than it fixes.
Make sure scanning is performed every time a floppy disk is used or each time a file is downloaded.

                    <text>It should be possible to find software that meets 95 percent of your needs.
Look at programs that are used primarily by the same type of retailer, so that the majority of the enhancements and research and development will have been done to benefit your type of business.
Software should be reasonably customizable, without the need for major modifications.
And remember to stay in the upgrade path and never fall more than one release behind.

                    <text>9. No Open-to-buy Plan and No Plan to Sell Use an open-to-buy program every month and one that assists in planning sales and events.
Re-key or move your actuals into it and do the same with cash flow.
If this is not done, over buying and over inventory could occur and could cause a cash crunch every month.
The best open to buy programs are spreadsheet driven and allow you to do many &quot;what if&quot; calculations as well as update each month as your real numbers come in.

It’s a personal computer (PC) connected to a receipt printer, cash drawer, credit/debit card reader and bar code scanner.

                    <text>A good POS system achieves two goals.
First, it makes the entire process of paying for an item simple and fast.
This is achieved by scanning the item with the bar code scanner, (instead of keying in long numbers), getting the customer’s phone number (so you can tie each sale to an individual client) and totaling the purchase and accepting payment easily (the credit/debit card reader automatically dials the bank and gets approval in seconds).

                <section>
                    <text>Furthermore, if the customer wants to &quot;multiple tender&quot;, which means pay part of the bill with cash and part with a credit card, the task can be accomplished quickly and easily.
A good POS system will also allow you to suspend a transaction which is invaluable for those times when a customer forgets their wallet in the car or has to run to the back of the store for something they forgot while two or three customers are waiting to check out.
With transaction suspense, you can simply touch one key, take care of the other customers in line and when the first customer returns, retrieve the transaction and complete it without re-entering all the items.

                    <text>The second goal of a POS system is to keep track of what your customers are buying and who they are.
A good system will give you reports on what’s selling, at what times of the day or week, to which type of customer and by which sales people.
A good POS will also allow you to have reminder dates for each customer so you can call or email them prior to an anniversary or birthday or any other event that they would appreciate that you track for them.

Also, a large part of your budget is for training and whatever you do, never skimp on training yourself and your staff on the system.

As a matter of fact, all of my comments up to now on POS system really meant a fully integrated system including inventory, purchase order and customer database controls.
The good systems are fully integrated and one of the most important components is the customer database program which allows you to identify which customers purchased what items.

A good computer system can allow you to look at inventory on a daily basis, identify what items are not selling and focus attention on problem areas, identify hot items and confirm that there is enough stock on hand and on order to meet the demand.
You will soon discover, however, that you will also need an additional piece of software called a spreadsheet (Lotus or Excel) to prepare your open-to-buy budgets.

                    <text>Yes it will.
There is no way around it.
If you sell by the SKU you have to buy by the SKU and make sure that every item in your store has a bar code.
The good news is that many suppliers are starting to put UPC bar codes on their products and this saves us money by not having to put them on ourselves.

Just kidding!
Even at current sales of $200,000 the $3,000 a year investment that I talked about earlier is only one and a half percent of your sales.
This percentage is what most retailers spend on technology today.

Figure at least $500 per employee for basic training and up to $2,000 for complete full system training.
Most of your employees will only need the basics and you can implement a ‘train the trainer’ format where you go and get the training and then give it to your staff.
Also, look for companies that have good software manuals.
This reduces training costs.

                    <text>It can track theft and inform you of how much you’re losing, but it can’t tell you who’s doing it.
Only a video camera can do that.
You also have to be careful of human error which can cause what appears to be theft, but are actually bookkeeping errors.
For example, if you receive 36 items that are supposed to sell for $45 each and a price label falls off and it’s sold for $40, the system will report a $5 shrink.
Human error accounts for over half of most stores’ shrinkage.

It’s best to go with a software company that specializes in your type of store.
The main reason is not that the clothing software won’t work for you (it probably will as clothing software is amongst the most complex due to size and color issues) but rather that any new developments in the software may not be built around your shop needs.

Often, if this number of abandoned baskets is high it is a pretty strong indicator that our lineups were too long at POS and the customer got frustrated and left.
Now, this is not the reason for every abandoned basket, some are due to genuine emergencies that customers have (such as forgetting their wallets!).

In supermarkets if you had ten percent abandoned baskets you would have a serious problem, on some web sites abandoned baskets can approach 30% or higher.
Clearly showing a real problem with that Point of Sale.

What we are seeing is that the slow-to-web brick and mortar retailers are now beginning to adopt a multi channel approach.

What we often fail to notice is that one of the reasons for this is the hardware that these companies use.
POS hardware is often the most overlooked and under planned component in almost all independent retail businesses.
Often the owner or manager selects a PC based POS system and then makes the mistake of believing that one computer is the same as another, and price becomes the determining factor.

Then, when confronted with the credit card dilemma, often opt for a free standing credit card approval box that is separate from their PC system.
Is it any wonder that after a few months the keyboard begins to stick, the scanner no longer works, the credit card machine falls off the counter, the printer jams or produces receipts that are all but unreadable?

As retailers we try to impress upon our customers the folly of trying to get something for nothing, and the lesson that quality and functionality do not come cheap.
How often have you wanted to grab a customer, shake them and tell them that you can’t pay $12.00 for an item and expect it to perform and last like a $50.00 item?

                    <text>Scanners should be laser and be able to read a bar code from at least six inches away, keyboards should be heavy duty and have a built in card swipe for credit cards.
Many retailers are also not providing customer pole displays and this is often a mistake.
Today, customers are very interested in what items are scanning at, and a customer display is a great service to the customer.
How many of us have to wait to read the receipt to know that we were charged the wrong price?

By reducing the time for customer check out, we can sell more customers with less staff time and in high transaction environments, even with fewer lanes.

A study that we did a few years ago demonstrated that automated POS increased profitability by over 25% in a gift store.

                    <text>Point of sale is where it all takes place in a store.
If I can’t quickly and efficiently collect the sales dollars from my customers, they will go elsewhere.
Have you ever wondered why the major retailers have those great big, heavy-duty cash registers at point of sale?
You might figure that they could just get away with a low price PC and cash drawer.

                    <text>What the big retailers have discovered is that well made POS equipment and software pays for itself in a very short period of time.
They seldom have any bottlenecks at point of sale and their hardware and software stands up to very tough use.
This quality and reliability costs money.
A good PC and cash drawer configuration is only about 50% more expensive than the low price models, but the peace of mind and service to the customer is always worth much more.

We often do not ever compute the cost of all the breakdowns on the cheap products and the extra time spent self teaching ourselves the wrong way to do something on our machines.

                    <text>If we spent a little more for hardware, software and training we would be amazed at how much productivity we would gain.
Expect to pay up to five to eight times the price of software to learn how to use it properly and up to 50% higher for better quality hardware.
Then you can and will get huge increases in productivity that will more than pay for this small investment.

                    <text>New POS machines are also making it easier to set up and change peripherals.
The new USB ports are making it very easy to add not only receipt printers, but also report printers, scanners, scales, customer pole displays, cash drawers and other devices that we may need to change quickly.
A good rule of thumb for POS is that it should be easy for our staff to learn and use and fast and almost transparent for our customers.

                    <text>With Maptitude you can create a circular service area that encompasses a set of points such as addresses.
You can then choose to weight the center location by a field in your point layer such as demand (Figure 2).

                    <text>For example, if you are considering relocating a store, you can create a trade area around your customers and weight the center by their sales volume to determine a new candidate location.
Alternatively, you may have a database of client employees.
You can then use Maptitude to see the best central location based on the density and distribution of the addresses.
These could be weighted by seniority, allowing you to better explore potential site locations by considering staff characteristics.

                    <text>* You want to determine the number of facilities that are required to guarantee a certain level of service. * You may also need to account for financial or operational constraints, such as a maximum number of facilities you are able to add, or a fixed budget for adding facilities. * Revenues and profits depend on the choice of facility locations.
In these cases, you need to balance the cost of adding a facility with the potential revenue benefit. * You want to maximize the distance between facilities and the population they serve.
For example, to minimize proximity to a competitor.

In addition, you may want to consider both adding new facilities and closing one or more existing facilities.

                    <text>CipherLab's Intelligent Order Entry (IOE), designed specifically for use by grocery and C-stores, ensures that shipping container space is maximized to resolve packing problems and reduce overall freight costs.
When used in conjunction with CipherLab's handheld scanners, Intelligent Order Entry enables users to calculate the cubic footage and weight of bulk goods, thereby reducing wasted space in shipping containers.
The IOE program also alerts users to discontinued items, the availability of substitute items, converts UPC codes to warehouse codes and displays backroom inventory during the order process.

                    <text>The new Intelligent Order Entry can also assist grocers and retailers to more efficiently deliver goods by air, sea and rail.
Although it is initially developed for use in port facilities, the concept of &quot;cubing,&quot; or automatically calculating the cubic feet of container space, is the same for other forms of transportation.
The bottom line is that Intelligent Order Entry, when coupled with CipherLab handheld mobile computers, creates one of the most efficient systems of its type - and one that gives an almost immediate return on investment to customers.

Sure, the final retail units for non-backers won't be available until June , but around 50,000 lucky folks who pledged over $99 to OUYA's massively successful campaign will be receiving their units in the coming days.
We've already heardwhat developers have to say about it, but this week we got our first hands-on with the miniature, Tegra 3-powered game console we've been hearing so much about since last summer.

                    <text>* * * * * * See all photos 28 Photos Hardware Our first-blush impressions of the gamepad, unpaired from the console, are mostly positive.
The controller has a good heft to it, doesn't feel cheap and the buttons / analog sticks are appropriately clicky and maneuverable.
The only real issues are the shoulder buttons and triggers, which both look and feel cheap -- the triggers were actually a sticking point for OUYA with the development kit that launched last December, and it seems the company's still got some kinks to iron out there.

                    <text>The faceplate on each side of the controller's face detaches, which is where you replace the two AA batteries that power it.
OUYA also says it'll offer customizable faceplates, but, well, we're just not that excited by the prospect.
Additionally, since it's simply a Bluetooth controller, the OUYA gamepad can be used on any Bluetooth-compatible device; to that same end, any Bluetooth-enabled controller works wirelessly with OUYA (so, Sony's DualShock 3, for instance, but not Microsoft's Xbox 360 gamepad -- you'd have to plug in a wired 360 gamepad via USB).

                    <text>The console itself is incredibly small.
It's less than half the size of the gamepad, actually.
What it lacks in size, however, it makes up for in density.
The OUYA is a heavy little box, intentionally weighted to support the various cables you'll plug into its rear to hook it up to your television.

                    <text>It's also incredibly quiet -- with no discs to spin and a fan that rarely kicks up dust, the OUYA runs whisper-quiet.
Beyond just quiet and heavy, though, the OUYA is a pretty little thing.
The brushed aluminum on its four sides looks sharp, and the tinted, glossy plastic up top gives the console a quality look.
Hiding the fan on the bottom is another nice touch -- Jawbone Jambox designerYves Béhar sculpted a final product that both stands out and subtly fits into existing media centers.

                    <text>Software OUYA's software UI is, to put it lightly, very sparse.
Just four submenus branch from the main dashboard: Play, Discover, Make and Manage.
The Manage menu is little more than a way to directly access the hidden Android settings -- it brings up a standard Android settings menu, which we're told will be swapped for a custom screen in the future -- so let's put that aside for now.
Play acts as your content manager, where both games and applications that you've downloaded reside.

Discover is perhaps the most interesting of the areas -- it's a stand-in for &quot;place where you purchase content&quot; -- and it's a curated store helmed by recent hire Kellee Santiago.

                    <text>Not only does it allow for various categorical organization and featured games, but it also enables popular games to bubble up naturally via thumbs-up icons that users can employ for each game.
Make is another unique twist, offering a section for devs to upload builds of their games for all to play; call it a glorified beta section, but its promise is what excites us most.
Not only can devs upload and crowdtest their games, but players can test out their own builds on the fly through sideloading.

                    <text>Troubling, however, is the noticeable lag between the game controller and the OUYA.
From games to UI, the lag was a noticeable issue -- other journalists we spoke with encountered the same issue.
It's not something that's impossible to fix, of course.
Even Nintendo's speeding up its Wii U software issuesin an upcoming patch , so it wouldn't be a huge surprise to see OUYA correcting the lag issue before June's retail launch.

                    <text>It's also hard to fault what is -- for now -- a niggling issue with a $100 game console that went from Kickstarter to available in around 10 months.
The promise of the console is far more appealing, and the time we've spent with the OUYA has us even more excited for its unknown future.

                    <text>It's also another reminder that late CEO Steve Jobs is gone and Tim Cook is working to remold the company in a more modern mode as it moves forward.
Cook said Scott Forstall, who heads mobile software, and retail chief John Browett are leaving Forstall, an Apple veteran is the biggest executive packing up his desk.
For many years, Forstall ran software development for the iPad and iPhone and many felt he most closely embodied Jobs' technology ideas.

                    <text>— Michael Simmons (@macguitar) October 30, 2012 Well, it seems Forstall was the one who should have apologized for the matter, but he refused to sign a public apology, leaving it up to his boss.
He also dismissed the problems as being exaggerated, said a source who declined to be named.
His stance mirrored what Jobs did back when the antennae would not work on a previous iPhone, and the late CEO implied the problem was mainly user error.

Apparently, Forstall was fighting with other executives as well over design issues.

                    <text>One of the emerging trends in the technology space is something known as Software as a Service (SaaS).
This paper provides an overview of different architectures, their pros and cons, and the key technologies that are reinventing the centralized architecture now known as Software as a Service.

                    <text>Introduction The retail industry is known to lag behind other industries in adopting new technology.
One of the major reasons is the razor-thin margins with which retailers work, which demand the quick return on investment (ROI) that are usually granted only by established technologies and methodologies Looking back, the evolution of retail architecture has thus followed what happened in other industrial sectors, moving from mainframe-based centralized architecture towards a departmental architecture where mini and personal computers brought data processing inside the stores.
However, this shift created the new problem of data exchange with corporate systems.

                    <text>The evolution continued with client-server and then distributed architectures and now is evolving towards service-oriented architecture (SOA).
Also, new concepts like Software as a Service (SaaS) , which are achieving considerable success in the customer-relations management (CRM) sector, are not present yet in the store applications; but the situation is changing.
This paper will provide an overview of SaaS and applicable technologies and their benefits to the retail industry.

                    <text>Business Challenges Retail presents some peculiar challenges.
Inside the store, there are two very distinct software functions: the store front, which is the &quot;public&quot; part devoted to check out that accesses data on products, customers, promotions, and so on; and the store back-office or &quot;private&quot; part of the store systems, for stock management, replenishment, reporting, labor scheduling, and inventory management.
In some really small-footprint stores, both functions are carried out on the same physical computer, but they remain very distinct in nature.

                    <text>Point-of-Sale Transactions In retail, the point-of-sale (POS) transactions are extremely important, yet have unique issues when compared to similar transactions in the B2B world.
An obvious question is: Why is the problem of a delay in issuing a small valued ticket (due to a hardware or software failure, or just slow response time) so critical?

The reason for this is twofold:

                    <text>* Stores make their profits from a high number of low-value transactions, usually concentrated in part of the day or part of the week and the check-out operations cannot be delayed during these times. * A POS interruption, even for a limited time, may cause not only significant economic losses but, even more important, losses of customers gained with expensive and long effort.
The bottom line is that POS is more mission-critical than the back office.

It also points to the possibility of back-office functions running either inside the store or provided by a service providers over the Internet.

                    <text>The Distributed vs. Centralized Architecture Dilemma Outside the store, there are many centralized activities, such as logistics, marketing, bookkeeping, and so on.
The efficiency of the retail activity depends on quantity and quality of data flow inside and outside the store.
Software architectural choices are very important and difficult, because reliability and data sharing are conflicting factors.

                    <text>Traditionally, POS systems are autonomous systems that exchange flat files in batch mode with back-office systems for stock management and reporting.
In the same offline mode and after a role change, the back-office system exchanges sales and item data with corporate systems and other partners.
This is defined asdistributed architecture where operations are supported by a local database, so that no external failure can stop such vital operations.

                    <text>The distributed architecture has a reliability and scalability advantage because it has no single point of failure and processing is distributed, but requires a complex synchronization activity among autonomous systems with their own databases and an expensive deployment.
Store-sales information must be uploaded to the corporate systems and item and promotion information must be downloaded to the store systems.

                    <text>In the centralized architecture, the store front-end systems (POS terminals, self service kiosks, and so forth) are connected online to the store server over a network and exchange sales information in real time.
In the same way, the store back-office systems can be connected online to the corporate systems for exchanging sales and item information.
Permanent connection over a network makes richer data available, such as a customer's previous transactions, specific promotions, real-time loyalty-points management, stock availability, and next delivery date.

                    <text>A centralized architecture with a single database solves the synchronization problem, but introduces a single point of failure and scalability limit, both inside the store for POS management and outside for connection to corporate systems.
The central server failure or a network failure stops the business completely, with very serious consequences.

                    <text>Unfortunately, it is not possible to achieve the advantages of the distributed architecture (such as reliability and scalability) without the burden of database synchronization.
Many organizations that need services given only by an online access to centralized data, being on the store or in the HQ, use redundant servers and connections or emergency operations, but at higher costs and complexity.

                    <text>When the data exchange among subsystems is performed by design with maximum fidelity, no data loss, and automatic updates, the architecture is defined as distributed.
Sometimes, the term &quot;distributed architecture&quot; is used for &quot;grid computing,&quot; the sharing of resources through a network of generic computers arranged to create a virtual super computer.
In our case, the term &quot;distributed&quot; is used just to emphasize a high integration level among subsystems obtained at the application level, and not at the operating system level.

                    <text>Client-Server Architecture In the client-server architecture—as the name implies—the client asks for some service, which the server will fulfill.
The client-server architecture represented an improvement over centralized architecture, because presentation and user-interaction functions are transferred from the server to the client—normally, on a PC with a processing power much higher than the old green terminals.

However, they are not a solution for a POS where only a local application with a local database can provide the necessary functionality and availability.

                    <text>To meet this need, there is a new model—based on XML and Web services—that is delivering rich services from an array of heterogeneous applications in a distributed architecture.
Service orientation (SO) is the natural evolution of current development models.
The 1980s saw the object-oriented models; then, there was the component-based development model in the 1990s; and, now, we have service orientation.

                    <text>Service orientation retains the benefits of component-based development (self-description, encapsulation, dynamic discovery, and loading), but there is a shift in paradigm from remotely invoking methods on objects, to one of passing messages among services.
Schemas describe not only the structure of messages, but also behavioral contracts to define acceptable message-exchange patterns and policies to define service semantics.
This promotes interoperability and, thus, provides adaptability benefits, as messages can be sent from one service to another without considering how the service handling those messages has been implemented.

                    <text>Service orientation provides an evolutionary approach to building distributed software that facilitates loosely coupled integration with its inherent scalability and resilience.
With the advent of the WS-* specifications, Web services architecture has made service-oriented software development feasible by virtue of mainstream development tools support and broad industry interoperability.
Although most frequently implemented using industry-standard Web services, service orientation is independent of technology and its architectural patterns, and can be used to connect with legacy systems, too.

As awareness and excitement around SOA have swelled, the clear lines that once defined service orientation have been blurred.
However SO does offer some specific benefits when used for the right purpose.

                    <text>When a service is being built to support many customer needs, it is best to consider building it as configurable and scalable service that uses metadata to provide different experiences to customers.
A centralized service that can support many customers with different requirements through metadata-based configuration is defined &quot;multitenant&quot; and offers the best ROI, because it can provide different experiences to different customers through configuration, reducing the cost of infrastructure.
Using a housing metaphor, a multitenant system is comparable to a block where a number of different flats share land, stairs, roof, and so on.

SaaS is going to have a major impact on the software industry, because it will change the way in which people build, sell, buy, and use software.
For this to happen, however, software vendors need resources and information about developing SaaS applications effectively.

As mentioned previously, in some ways, these early attempts at Internet-delivered software had more in common with traditional on-premise applications than with modern SaaS applications, such as licensing and architecture.

                    <text>Because these applications were originally built as single-tenant applications, their ability to share data and processes with other applications was limited, and they tended to offer few economic benefits over their locally installed counterparts.
Today, SaaS applications are expected to take advantage of the benefits of centralization through a single-instance, multitenant architecture, and to provide a feature-rich experience competitive with comparable on-premise applications.
A typical SaaS application is offered either directly by the vendor or by an intermediary party called an aggregator, which bundles SaaS offerings from different vendors and offers them as part of a unified application platform.

Many vendors provide application programming interfaces (API) that expose the applications' data and functionality to developers for use in creating composite applications.

So, retailers are forced to decide whether to carry the remaining 80 percent of non-popular merchandise in the store or carry more of the popular merchandise.
The traditional &quot;brick-and-mortar&quot; retailers concentrate on selling the more popular items, because they cannot possibly stock non-popular merchandise.

Access to this long tail of low-volume sales translates into a huge amount of revenue.

                    <text>* Upfront investment—The cost of the central system is usually not directly proportional to the number of stores, weighing more on small or new chains. * Deployment cost—Traditional software must be installed and maintained by competent technicians traveling from store to store with high cost and limited peak capacity.
Also, remote maintenance over the Internet is usually done one store at a time. * Technical competence—Successful retailers are usually more competent on customer needs and products/services than on IT operations. * Data-sharing difficulties—It is quite easy to share data with HQ, but complex to do with third parties—such as independent logistics, product catalogues, and market analysis—or when exchanging customer data with other non-competing chains for joint-loyalty programs. * Cost of new software-feature implementation—The new feature, even if already available, must be bought and deployed over some test stores.
If acceptable, the general deployment cannot be immediate.

                    <text>What SaaS offers is an opportunity to provide customized services to many small customers using a single platform, which cannot be accomplished through traditional means.
A widely known example of SaaS is SalesForce.Com, which is able to offer CRM capabilities to many customers over the Internet using a single system.
This ability to offer functionality to multiple tenants is the biggest advantage of SaaS.

                    <text>There are many other areas in which retailers can benefit from SaaS applications.
For example, a retail enterprise, switching from old systems to a SaaS POS integrated with their ERP, allows the implementation of very sophisticated and new fidelity initiatives, so they can securely share data with other non-competing chains through centralized retail Web services.

Because of this, with SaaS, an independent store can use the same software as the large enterprise retailer—eventually, using it in more creative and effective ways.

                    <text>There is one key difference in the process of how traditional software is sold, deployed, and used compared to SaaS-based applications.
Selling SaaS is like selling mobile-phone ringtones or downloadable music: It should be possible for a customer to visit a SaaS provider's site, subscribe to the service, pay with a credit card, customize the service, and begin using it—all without human intervention on the part of the service provider.

                    <text>This does not mean that a more personal approach is completely eliminated.
It can still be used for larger retailers with more extensive needs.
But designing the sales, marketing, provisioning, and customization processes from the ground up to work automatically makes it possible to offer an automated approach as a choice; also, it has the happy side effect of simplifying the work that the support personnel of the service provider must perform to accomplish the same tasks on behalf of a customer.

According to this model, as soon as the services architecture is achieved, some of the services can be outsourced to a SaaS-based service provider over the Internet.

                    <text>In this retail-based example, the fourth model shows that the end-user application is composed of services—some of which are hosted internally and some of which are provided by the SaaS-based service provider.
This composition layer can be realized using either an AJAX-based thin client or a smart client.
The selection should be based on the business function and requirements for up time.

                    <text>We have over 10 years experience working with Tyler software.
Our Tyler experience first began back in 1999 when Pauleen Miller, the founder of Rock Creek Consulting Group, started working as a Controller for an electronics retailer with 4 store locations and a service department.
Not only was she responsible for accounting, she was also responsible for all aspects of processing including Point of Sale, Merchandise and Service Parts Inventory, PO’s, Sales Analysis reporting, system administration such as terminal set-up, passwords, QADM,RDB’s and much, much more.

                    <text>Possessing all the great features of other modern POS systems like inventory, customer, and employee management functions, as well as unprecedented international business capabilities, the software almost seems too good to be true.
Unfortunately it just may be so.
In my research I uncovered a recent history of SEC charges, accounting fraud, and chapter 11 bankruptcy that sent me running for the hills.

                    <text>Retail Pro International LLC. started off as Retail Technologies Inc. in Folsom, CA.
Coming from humble beginnings, the company seemed to be doing pretty well by 1997, reporting an estimated $36 million in sales.

                    <text>By December of 2002, the company had grown to a staff of 80 employees and sold part of its business to Intuit, the makers of QuickBooks Point of Sale.
In 2004 an Irvine-based company by the name of Island Pacific Inc. bought Retail Technologies and by 2007 sold off its merchandising division Island Pacific Management Systems for $16 million.
What was left was renamed Retail Pro Inc. and its offices were moved from Irvine to La Jolla, CA.

                    <text>By 2008 problems started to arise for the company.
The federal SEC filed fraud charges against Retail Pro Inc., its two former CEO's Barry Schechter and Ran Furman, and its one former CFO Harvey Braun.
The three were involved in a fraudulent accounting scheme in which they improperly recorded and reported $3.9 million in revenue from a &quot;barter transaction,&quot; whose sole purpose was to manipulate the company's books to reflect inflated revenue.

                    <text>The SEC uncovered overstated 2004 revenues by up to 140%, making the company show profit when in actuality it was in the red.
To make matters worse the three executives concealed the barter from external auditors by forging documents.
Schechter even sold his company stock shares during the scheme, an estimated 637,750 shares for $1.5 million.
A settlement was configured for each of the defendants with Schechter taking the biggest blow, having to pay an estimated $635,847.

                    <text>In the midst of scandal Retail Pro was not doing well financially, defaulting on loans to investors Laurus Master Fund Ltd., Midsummer Investments Ltd., and Valens Offshore SPV II Corp.
By January 2009 the company filed chapter 11 bankruptcy.
At the time the company's assets totaled about $25 million, with debts of $29 million and liabilities of $50 million, owing over 200 creditors.

News of the filing caused the company's 61.5 million stock shares to trade at less than a penny a share.
Many retailers began abandoning the software as well; as one former user put it: &quot;We are jumping ship as fast as we can...this company is doomed!&quot;

                    <text>Investment firms Laurus and Valens took ownership of the company following the bankruptcy and shut down the La Jolla office, moving all operations to Folsom.
The company continued to operate during the transition and restructuring, and surprisingly did not lose as many customers or affiliates as expected.
Under the new name Retail Pro International LLC. and new CEO Kerry Lemos (formerly of Hotel Information Systems and Sage), the company added more staff to the Folsom operations to total about 60, and is suspected of generating more than $1 million in monthly revenue.

The system runs with an Oracle database allowing for unlimited scalability.
Also it supports both SQL and XML formats for custom development.

                    <text>* POS - Like most other software we've seen, the POS function will automatically calculate and add sales tax, accept payment in multiple tenders (cash, check, credit, debit, gift card), allow customer info tracking, employee sales tracking, complete discounts/offers/special promotions, and allow for voids or returns.
Dependant upon the customer or items being purchased, prompts can be set up for the cashier to suggest relevant up-sells, cross-sells, or volume discounts.
Also receipts can be customized to include company logos and personal messages (e.g. &quot;have a nice day!&quot;). One neat function that's worth noting is the POS screen is customizable to perform special functions at different cash wraps (e.g. special orders, layaways, returns/exchanges, etc.).

Maintain vendors, departments, items, styles, colors, sizes, SKUs, serial numbers, costs, prices, counts, and even item images.
Also the system's style matrix allows for easy input and tracking of items that may vary by style, color, or size.

                    <text>Not only does the system also allow for the transfer of inventory between stores, but the auto-transfer recommendation function will prompt you to transfer when stock levels are skewed between stores. * Purchase Order/Receiving Management - Preset your minimum and maximum stock levels for automatic notices to reorder inventory; or set for auto PO creation to even further simplify maintaining your inventory.
Once items are received they will be allocated accordingly and inventory automatically updated. Also the system supports ASN (automated shipment notice) in-transit monitoring.
ASN's are electronic files usually containing shipment date, time, ID #, packing slip data, freight information, item detail (including quantities), and PO #.

The system supports a multi-language (up to 18 different languages) and multi-currency interface.
You can select 1 currency as your base currency and then assign exchange rates as needed for foreign currency as well as dates for rates to take effect.

Rewards can be determined either on the currency value or point value of purchases.
This can be done in three ways: total-based, item-based, and gift-based.

                    <text>Total-based means point values are calculated by the total amount of receipts (so you spend a certain amount of money and receive a certain amount of points).
Item-based is the same thing except different items have different points and some are not included at all (so you can push certain goods you are trying to unload).
Finally gift-based means customers receive free merchandise as opposed to points to redeem. All point information is updated instantaneously so there can be no double-dipping done due to slow data transfer.

UniteU also integrates with websites like eBay and Amazon, collecting orders from them and passing them through to Retail Pro, widening your sales reach.

                    <text>Being that company CEO Kerry Lemos used to work for Sage, it makes perfect sense that the software integrates with Sage accounting applications MAS 90 and MAS 200.
Data seamlessly transfers to the GL and AR modules of MAS software to shortcut lengthy data re-entry that often comes along with bookkeeping.

                    <text>Additionally, the company's Enterprise Integration Manager application (offered for an additional unknown fee) will help integrate the Retail Pro software with almost any other data management application.
The manager's interface allows merchants to define data output formats, transformation rules, and map destination locations in conjunction with the specifications of the target application.
If it sounds complicated to you don't worry...it does to me too.

Unfortunately a lot of these apps are overpriced and - in my opinion - things that should be standard with the software.

Some of the apps even run into the thousands of dollars, like the Microsoft Dynamics GP Accounting Link ($7000.00) or the TrendaSource Enterprise: Retail Pro Integrated Ecommerce Solution ($12,000.00).

If you buy this I suggest that you need a serious budget for support and consultancy.
This may be OK on a large multiple store install but on a single station it may kill your project.  - Martin4830 To do your own research for more complaints and reviews, you can search for terms like:

                    <text>Capturing client information is very important.
The nature of our product is that you replenish after running out in three months.
With the customer data we capture through our POS system, we know when they run out and how they prefer to be contacted.
This aims to increase both sales and profitability, because repeat purchases provide the highest margins.

The purchase order system is very good, provides great tracking of backorder items, it has the capability of doing auto ordering based upon predefined min/max quantities. -Craig Anonymous Easy to use POS/receiving/transfer system.
Reports are numerous and easy to customize. It has saved us countless hours versus doing hand tickets. -Don of Am/Pat Inc.

On the one hand the software is used by many high-end businesses, has many positive reviews (with few negatives), seems to come with a bounty of features, and is the only POS we've reviewed so far with such high international functionality.

Even though the company's past problems were the result of an entirely separate management, it's still a factor we cannot ignore.

CounterPoint and their local representative, Image Business Systems, has more than met our needs.

I would have given it five stars for Ease of Use, except that I am a new user and am still learning my way around the system.
That said, it is easy to figure out how to do certain tasks, but when I can't figure it out, their customer support is top notch.

                    <text>I went with CounterPoint, v8.4 because it is affiliated with NCR, a major corporation that has been around a long time.
The implementation team at Radiant Systems was excellent.
I had the system installed on my laptop, and so far it is working great.
As a new user, I am still learning how to do certain tasks, and the project team has continued to hold my hand until I have mastered all the basics.
We're almost there....

RCS outsources these modules to other companies so they can focus directly on the point of sale functionality and improvements and assure that the modules work properly with CounterPoint.

                    <text>Our previous software system, while specific to the marine industry and bundled with features we sorely miss, was unable to integrate e-commerce, point of sale, and shipping functionality.
The time we spent dealing with each order on three different levels was time-consuming, and also allowed for the introduction of errors.

                    <text>We are currently running version 8.3.9 of CounterPoint, but will be upgrading to 8.4 as soon as the season slows this fall.
The implementation experience was choppy, to say the least, due to a reseller that wasn't up to speed on the software.
This hiccup notwithstanding, we were able grasp the basics and run with it.

                    <text>We have been using CounterPoint for just under two years now and the watershed moment was when we switched partners nine months into the project.
Our reseller's knowledge of the system and ability to teach us its functionality have allowed us to move forward at a rapid pace.
The program is easy to use, and a common logic follows through the system so even when playing with new features, the desired result is easy to achieve.

                    <text>We are currently 95% integrated with UPS WorldShip.
The only thing holding us back from 100% integration is CounterPoint's inability to receive tracking numbers back from WorldShip without cumbersome export and import of data, or utilizing a third-party program.
We are currently investigating CPOnline with the hope of having full vertical integration by January 1, 2012.

Today, buyers are bringing their own technology on their shopping trips - and trailing a very revealing online data footprint.
One big enterprise software company is promising retailers new technology that will let retailers leverage that information to market to those consumers in real-time.

                    <text>For retailers and tech companies that serve them, billions of dollars are up for grabs.
If there were any doubts that there was real money to be made leveraging big data to create custom marketing pitches in real time, those doubts should be shattered by Tuesday's entrance of mega-software corporation SAP into the retail tech frenzy.
The move is the equivalent of an elephant walking into a room of working mice and telling everyone, &quot;I've got this.&quot;

                    <text>SAP's product is a new implementation of its upcoming NetWeaver Cloud called SAP Precision Retailing that uses the consumer's location, social profile, needs and the time at which they are conducting their business to generate relevant content (including discounts and special deals) designed to get that particular consumer to make the purchases the retailer desires.
Technology, then, as virtual salesperson.

                    <text>On the surface, this is nothing new.
Social media profiles have been used as a marketing tool for quite a while now, as have location-based services that suggest a business or product to you when you're nearby.
SAP's product, though, is a major effort to combine a lot of different inputs and process them in real-time.
SAP's pragmatic approach to this new market runs right up to the point of being just a bit creepy.

                    <text>That retailers are in the business of influencing customers is not new either - visit most any U.S. grocery store and you'll have to schlep back to the rear of the store just to get your milk.
The store is trying to make sure you see lots of other items to tempt you along the way.
But SAP's determination to extol the processing benefits of its new system seems destined to raise eyebrows among privacy advocates.

                    <text>The profile aspect of the new Precision Retailing product could be a red flag, since it mines past transaction history (online and in-store) and social media profiles to help figure out what it is you need and want.
Customers using this service will likely have given permission to the retailer to perform such actions when they click &quot;Accept&quot; for the Terms of Service, so there's no technical breach of privacy, but such real-time analysis could tip consumers into the creeped-out zone when they see it in action?

The product is already in use, and doing pretty well.

                    <text>Pluche related that one European grocery retailer with 12,000 stores in seven countries is using the Precision Retailing system to deliver discount information into customers' hands via smart devices and in-store kiosks.
The promotions were often the same ones that were email- and direct mail-blasted to customers, but Pluche explained that identical promotions see a conversion rate eight times higher when delivered directly as opposed to mass-distributed.
That's a piece of data sure to attract the attention of retailers.

                    <text>The Numbers Behind SAP's Product Retailers are very motivated to get technology like this in place.
A recent Retail Systems Research study noted the &quot;top 3 technologies reported by survey respondents were customer purchase analytics, CRM, and marketing operations planning&quot; - right where SAP's new product lives.
And despite few problems collecting customer data, only 56% of the retailer respondents now believe they know who their best shoppers are, a big drop from last year's 73% figure.

Precision Retailing's core technology,NetWeaver Cloud , is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud computing product that has not yet been generally released.
NetWeaver Cloud relies on SAP's HANA in-memory database, which competes directly withOracle's Exadata X3 database announced at OracleWorld this weekend .
SAP's launch of Precision Retailing is no doubt going to be used as an early showcase of what NetWeaver Cloud can do.

SAP may be one of the largest players in this rapidly evolving space, but it won't be the last.

                    <text>* A Los Angeles-based startup called Styku  has struck a deal to pilot its Kinect-powered virtual fitting room technology with a major retailer, a key step toward a broader rollout. * Toronto-based GestSure Technologies , has just received U.S. clearance to start offering its Kinect-based, hands-free technology for surgeons in operating rooms. * Ikkos Training , based in Seattle, has developed a Kinect app for virtual physical therapy, to supplement traditional sessions.
The sensor can count repetitions, among other features. * Nconnex , of Hadley, Mass., lets consumers scan a room with Kinect and insert virtual representations of furniture into the digital scene to see what it would look like in their space. * New York-based Voxon  is using Kinect to give artists and cinematographers the ability to create volumetric 3D productions reminiscent of the famous Princess Leia hologram from Star Wars. * ZebCare , from Boston, is using the Kinect to let families check the status of independent seniors without invading their privacy, providing a blurred-out overhead view and analytics.

But even if retailers are not disruptive themselves, as Terlep noted, when change happens, retailers have to adapt or they could lose out tremendously.

                    <text>The change started with the introduction of digital commerce, which made a large selection of merchandise available online, along with detailed information about retailers, and reviews and opinions of other customers.
It became easy for consumers to research products and even shop before going to a physical store.

Amazon claims that they are the highest-ranked retailer ever in terms of customer satisfaction.
During the 2011 holiday shopping season, over half of adults used smartphones for purchase decisions.
By 2014, experts expect that 90 percent of phones will be smartphones, Terlep said.

                    <text>Many retailers are unfortunately stuck in the analog era.
Some were burned by eCommerce 1.0.
Retailers like incremental change, but they’re now selling through multiple channels, or “omni-channel retailing,&quot; and that changes the dynamic greatly, said Terlep.

For example, a virtual point of sale, digital signage, and/or kiosk. * Creating the ability to access volumes of data near real-time.
From the organizational standpoint, Terlep suggests the following:

Retail IT is funded on a project-by-project basis from the line of business.
This isn’t as big a problem in retail as it is with other industries. * Hiring a staff of builders not administrators.

Companies need to decide what they want to become and chose their technology accordingly because the technology they use is what they will soon be (for better or for worse).

That means everybody needs access to timely and relevant information so they can act in real time to optimize their performance as conditions change.

                <section>
                    <text>Take a moment to think about that.
Many innovation initiatives fail miserably because their leaders don't understand this simple fact.
In fact, it is actually more important to have A-grade people than it is to have a slew of A-grade ideas because A-grade people can take a B-grade idea - or perhaps even a C-grade idea - and turn it into a successful reality.
B-grade people, on the other hand, will struggle with even truly great ideas.

This customer and market specialization is the most promising and the most sustainable source of profits in our fluid, real-time economy.&quot;

                    <text>Markup is the opposite of discount.
In discount, we reduce some percentage of amount from the initial amount, but in markup we increase certain percentage with the original amount.The mark up is the gross profit on a particular item or service.
If the cost is 100 and it sells for 150 the mark up is 50%.
The net profit takes in to account other factors like the rent of premises, cost of advertising and so on.
The mark up is just the gross profit, so in the given example the mark up would be 50.

Solution:   Markup = 50% of the cost price Markup = 50% of 100 = 50 selling price = cost + markup = 100+50 = 150 So the selling price of the item is 150 dollars.

                    <text>Enterprise application software performs business functions such as order processing, procurement, production scheduling, customer information management, energy management, and accounting.
It is typically hosted on servers and provides simultaneous services to a large number of users, typically over a computer network.
This is in contrast to a single-user application that is executed on a user's personal computer and serves only one user at a time.

All problems arecustomizable (meaning that you can change all parameters).
We try to have a comprehensive collection of school algebra problems.
The good news is that the steps to solve word problems are always the same.
The bad news is that you may have to think pretty hard.

I would have given it five stars for Ease of Use, except that I am a new user and am still learning my way around the system.
That said, it is easy to figure out how to do certain tasks, but when I can't figure it out, their customer support is top notch.

                    <text>I went with CounterPoint, v8.4 because it is affiliated with NCR, a major corporation that has been around a long time.
The implementation team at Radiant Systems was excellent.
I had the system installed on my laptop, and so far it is working great.
As a new user, I am still learning how to do certain tasks, and the project team has continued to hold my hand until I have mastered all the basics.
We're almost there....

                    <text>CounterPoint allows you to add on modules, such as integrated website management, gift card processing, scheduling and ticket sales, etc.
RCS outsources these modules to other companies so they can focus directly on the point of sale functionality and improvements and assure that the modules work properly with CounterPoint.

We have used CounterPoint since 2005.
Our shop previously had a cash register and the old source of look and order on inventory.
In 2005 the shop was handed over to new management, who researched and concluded to use CounterPoint.

We had version 7.5 until this past August and we upgraded to SQL.
Version 7 was great to work with but SQL is so much more...

It's a trick question.
What they want to know is how you delegated problems to the proper channels.
They want to know If you contacted your higher-ups with the present dilemna and gave them a briefing on the situation.
What you want to do is get the name of the person who has the problem, and his/her phone number.

The customer will have to be patient because there's nothing you can do.
You tell your co-workers about the situation, and let the next shift be aware of the situation as well.
It's all about communication and delegation of authority in business.
If you were hired to solve problems, then of course, tell them of your problem solving skills.  Every employee solves problems...

A customer wants a faucet that's on display.
You're completely out of them.
A good way to solve the problem would be to call another store that has some and get one sent to you.
You wouldn't delegate that problem to a &quot;proper channel&quot; because YOU are the proper channel.

                    <text>Agreed - This is not a trick question.
Basically, the interviewer wants to get an idea of your judgment and decision making skills as well as what factors you considered in your decision and whether or not you involved or consulted others.
More and more, companies are looking for critical thinkers who use good judgment both for the Customer and the company.

It allows you to flag potential problem areas, enter a title and notes, and easily return to them through a Flags icon found in the main menu across the top of the screen.
Although the system works well, the notes section of the flag is limited to very few characters.
If a problem needed a little explanation, the flagging system wouldn’t be that useful.

History Maxima is based on a 1982 version of Macsyma , which was developed at MIT with funding from the United States Department of Energy and other government agencies.
A version ofMacsyma was maintained byBill Schelter from 1982 until his death in 2001.

                    <text>In 1998, Schelter obtained permission from the Department of Energy to release his version under the GPL.
That version, now called Maxima, is maintained by an independent group of users and developers.

                    <text>Maxima does not include any of the many modifications and enhancements made to the commercial version ofMacsyma during 1982–1999.
Though the core functionality remains similar, code depending on these enhancements may not work on Maxima, and bugs which were fixed in Macsyma may still be present in Maxima, and vice-versa.

Features Maxima includes a complete programming language with ALGOL -like syntax but Lisp-like semantics.
It is written inCommon Lisp , and can be accessed programmatically and extended, as the underlying Lisp can be called from Maxima.
It usesGnuplot for drawing.

Numeric calculations Maxima is a full-featured CAS (computer algebra system ) that specializes in symbolic operations but it also offers numerical capabilities[1] such as arbitrary-precision arithmetic : integers and rational numbers which can grow to sizes limited only by machine memory, andfloating point numbers whose precision can be set arbitrarily large (&quot;bfloats&quot;).

The GNU TeXmacs and LyX mathematical editor programs can be used to provide an interactive GUI for Maxima, as can Sage.
Other options include the Imaxima front end, as well as an Emacs and Xemacs interaction mode which is activated byImaxima.

                    <text>Smart Client Software as a Service Key Microsoft Technologies Conclusion References Abstract IT is evolving rapidly, and the retail industry is looking at how it can improve business.
Retailers are facing the challenge of how best to meet the need of an increasingly demanding customer base, while reducing the overall costs.
In addition to meeting customer demands, retailers are facing the challenges of integrating their various functionalities and channels, which are mostly run as silos.

                    <text>Introduction The retail industry is known to lag behind other industries in adopting new technology.
One of the major reasons is the razor-thin margins with which retailers work, which demand the quick return on investment (ROI) that are usually granted only by established technologies and methodologies Looking back, the evolution of retail architecture has thus followed what happened in other industrial sectors, moving from mainframe-based centralized architecture towards a departmental architecture where mini and personal computers brought data processing inside the stores.
However, this shift created the new problem of data exchange with corporate systems.

                    <text>The evolution continued with client-server and then distributed architectures and now is evolving towards service-oriented architecture (SOA).
Also, new concepts like Software as a Service (SaaS) , which are achieving considerable success in the customer-relations management (CRM) sector, are not present yet in the store applications; but the situation is changing.
This paper will provide an overview of SaaS and applicable technologies and their benefits to the retail industry.

                    <text>Business Challenges Retail presents some peculiar challenges.
Inside the store, there are two very distinct software functions: the store front, which is the &quot;public&quot; part devoted to check out that accesses data on products, customers, promotions, and so on; and the store back-office or &quot;private&quot; part of the store systems, for stock management, replenishment, reporting, labor scheduling, and inventory management.
In some really small-footprint stores, both functions are carried out on the same physical computer, but they remain very distinct in nature.

                    <text>Point-of-Sale Transactions In retail, the point-of-sale (POS) transactions are extremely important, yet have unique issues when compared to similar transactions in the B2B world.
An obvious question is: Why is the problem of a delay in issuing a small valued ticket (due to a hardware or software failure, or just slow response time) so critical?

                    <text>The same problem for higher-valued invoices in a B2B transaction creates a limited problem, to the extent that it is not even noticed.
The reason for this is twofold:

                    <text>* Stores make their profits from a high number of low-value transactions, usually concentrated in part of the day or part of the week and the check-out operations cannot be delayed during these times. * A POS interruption, even for a limited time, may cause not only significant economic losses but, even more important, losses of customers gained with expensive and long effort.
The bottom line is that POS is more mission-critical than the back office.

It also points to the possibility of back-office functions running either inside the store or provided by a service providers over the Internet.

                    <text>The Distributed vs. Centralized Architecture Dilemma Outside the store, there are many centralized activities, such as logistics, marketing, bookkeeping, and so on.
The efficiency of the retail activity depends on quantity and quality of data flow inside and outside the store.
Software architectural choices are very important and difficult, because reliability and data sharing are conflicting factors.

                    <text>Traditionally, POS systems are autonomous systems that exchange flat files in batch mode with back-office systems for stock management and reporting.
In the same offline mode and after a role change, the back-office system exchanges sales and item data with corporate systems and other partners.
This is defined asdistributed architecture where operations are supported by a local database, so that no external failure can stop such vital operations.

                    <text>The distributed architecture has a reliability and scalability advantage because it has no single point of failure and processing is distributed, but requires a complex synchronization activity among autonomous systems with their own databases and an expensive deployment.
Store-sales information must be uploaded to the corporate systems and item and promotion information must be downloaded to the store systems.

                    <text>In the centralized architecture, the store front-end systems (POS terminals, self service kiosks, and so forth) are connected online to the store server over a network and exchange sales information in real time.
In the same way, the store back-office systems can be connected online to the corporate systems for exchanging sales and item information.
Permanent connection over a network makes richer data available, such as a customer's previous transactions, specific promotions, real-time loyalty-points management, stock availability, and next delivery date.

                    <text>A centralized architecture with a single database solves the synchronization problem, but introduces a single point of failure and scalability limit, both inside the store for POS management and outside for connection to corporate systems.
The central server failure or a network failure stops the business completely, with very serious consequences.

                    <text>Unfortunately, it is not possible to achieve the advantages of the distributed architecture (such as reliability and scalability) without the burden of database synchronization.
Many organizations that need services given only by an online access to centralized data, being on the store or in the HQ, use redundant servers and connections or emergency operations, but at higher costs and complexity.

                    <text>When the data exchange among subsystems is performed by design with maximum fidelity, no data loss, and automatic updates, the architecture is defined as distributed.
Sometimes, the term &quot;distributed architecture&quot; is used for &quot;grid computing,&quot; the sharing of resources through a network of generic computers arranged to create a virtual super computer.
In our case, the term &quot;distributed&quot; is used just to emphasize a high integration level among subsystems obtained at the application level, and not at the operating system level.

                    <text>Client-Server Architecture In the client-server architecture—as the name implies—the client asks for some service, which the server will fulfill.
The client-server architecture represented an improvement over centralized architecture, because presentation and user-interaction functions are transferred from the server to the client—normally, on a PC with a processing power much higher than the old green terminals.

Also client-server applications, which depend heavily on the connectivity, received a huge boost due to the widespread availability of virtual private networks (VPN).

                    <text>In the retail industry, the success of ASP-based solutions was even lower, because the mission-critical nature of POS operations demands availability of service and local data even during the loss of connectivity.
In other words, offline operations are critical in retail from both business and psychological points of view.

                    <text>To meet this need, there is a new model—based on XML and Web services—that is delivering rich services from an array of heterogeneous applications in a distributed architecture.
Service orientation (SO) is the natural evolution of current development models.
The 1980s saw the object-oriented models; then, there was the component-based development model in the 1990s; and, now, we have service orientation.

                    <text>Service orientation retains the benefits of component-based development (self-description, encapsulation, dynamic discovery, and loading), but there is a shift in paradigm from remotely invoking methods on objects, to one of passing messages among services.
Schemas describe not only the structure of messages, but also behavioral contracts to define acceptable message-exchange patterns and policies to define service semantics.
This promotes interoperability and, thus, provides adaptability benefits, as messages can be sent from one service to another without considering how the service handling those messages has been implemented.

                    <text>Service orientation provides an evolutionary approach to building distributed software that facilitates loosely coupled integration with its inherent scalability and resilience.
With the advent of the WS-* specifications, Web services architecture has made service-oriented software development feasible by virtue of mainstream development tools support and broad industry interoperability.
Although most frequently implemented using industry-standard Web services, service orientation is independent of technology and its architectural patterns, and can be used to connect with legacy systems, too.

As awareness and excitement around SOA have swelled, the clear lines that once defined service orientation have been blurred.
However SO does offer some specific benefits when used for the right purpose.

                    <text>When a service is being built to support many customer needs, it is best to consider building it as configurable and scalable service that uses metadata to provide different experiences to customers.
A centralized service that can support many customers with different requirements through metadata-based configuration is defined &quot;multitenant&quot; and offers the best ROI, because it can provide different experiences to different customers through configuration, reducing the cost of infrastructure.
Using a housing metaphor, a multitenant system is comparable to a block where a number of different flats share land, stairs, roof, and so on.

For this to happen, however, software vendors need resources and information about developing SaaS applications effectively.

As mentioned previously, in some ways, these early attempts at Internet-delivered software had more in common with traditional on-premise applications than with modern SaaS applications, such as licensing and architecture.

                    <text>Because these applications were originally built as single-tenant applications, their ability to share data and processes with other applications was limited, and they tended to offer few economic benefits over their locally installed counterparts.
Today, SaaS applications are expected to take advantage of the benefits of centralization through a single-instance, multitenant architecture, and to provide a feature-rich experience competitive with comparable on-premise applications.
A typical SaaS application is offered either directly by the vendor or by an intermediary party called an aggregator, which bundles SaaS offerings from different vendors and offers them as part of a unified application platform.

Many vendors provide application programming interfaces (API) that expose the applications' data and functionality to developers for use in creating composite applications.

So, retailers are forced to decide whether to carry the remaining 80 percent of non-popular merchandise in the store or carry more of the popular merchandise.
The traditional &quot;brick-and-mortar&quot; retailers concentrate on selling the more popular items, because they cannot possibly stock non-popular merchandise.

Access to this long tail of low-volume sales translates into a huge amount of revenue.

                    <text>* Upfront investment—The cost of the central system is usually not directly proportional to the number of stores, weighing more on small or new chains. * Deployment cost—Traditional software must be installed and maintained by competent technicians traveling from store to store with high cost and limited peak capacity.
Also, remote maintenance over the Internet is usually done one store at a time. * Technical competence—Successful retailers are usually more competent on customer needs and products/services than on IT operations. * Data-sharing difficulties—It is quite easy to share data with HQ, but complex to do with third parties—such as independent logistics, product catalogues, and market analysis—or when exchanging customer data with other non-competing chains for joint-loyalty programs. * Cost of new software-feature implementation—The new feature, even if already available, must be bought and deployed over some test stores.
If acceptable, the general deployment cannot be immediate.

                    <text>What SaaS offers is an opportunity to provide customized services to many small customers using a single platform, which cannot be accomplished through traditional means.
A widely known example of SaaS is SalesForce.Com, which is able to offer CRM capabilities to many customers over the Internet using a single system.
This ability to offer functionality to multiple tenants is the biggest advantage of SaaS.

                    <text>There are many other areas in which retailers can benefit from SaaS applications.
For example, a retail enterprise, switching from old systems to a SaaS POS integrated with their ERP, allows the implementation of very sophisticated and new fidelity initiatives, so they can securely share data with other non-competing chains through centralized retail Web services.

Because of this, with SaaS, an independent store can use the same software as the large enterprise retailer—eventually, using it in more creative and effective ways.

                    <text>There is one key difference in the process of how traditional software is sold, deployed, and used compared to SaaS-based applications.
Selling SaaS is like selling mobile-phone ringtones or downloadable music: It should be possible for a customer to visit a SaaS provider's site, subscribe to the service, pay with a credit card, customize the service, and begin using it—all without human intervention on the part of the service provider.

                    <text>This does not mean that a more personal approach is completely eliminated.
It can still be used for larger retailers with more extensive needs.
But designing the sales, marketing, provisioning, and customization processes from the ground up to work automatically makes it possible to offer an automated approach as a choice; also, it has the happy side effect of simplifying the work that the support personnel of the service provider must perform to accomplish the same tasks on behalf of a customer.

This composition layer can be realized using either an AJAX-based thin client or a smart client.
The selection should be based on the business function and requirements for up time.

eCommerce retailers, however, have eCommerce guided selling solutions available to create a better online shopping experience for customers. 
Depending on the complexity of products offered, retailers may choose one online assisted selling tool over another.

He also addressed the debate on whether process or tooling is more inhibiting to this approach.

In fact it took an agonising 24 hours for the 100,000+ tickets to go, despite the huge demand on the day.
Being made to wait for so long in telephone queues, or on slowly loading, bug-ridden or crashed websites, is a sure fire way to frustrate customers and create a PR nightmare.

Don’t let the website crash A good online checkout should be like shopping in a supermarket with plenty of open tills.
Photo – Flickr/nateOne Even when your warehouse’s shelves are stocked, your supply is directly proportional to your website’s availability, speed and performance.
Your customer satisfaction levels also hit a glass ceiling when your website can’t cope with demand.

                    <text>This morning, the Nexus 4 phone sold out in the UK through Google’s online Play Store in less than 30 minutes.
However, buyers and would-be buyers alike reported website inconsistencies, errors, freeze-ups, slow-downs, failed transactions, mistaken duplicate transactions, and lack of purchase confirmation.
And this is the renowned kings of web speed Google.
So how do you keep a website up and customers happy when there’s such high demand?

Imagine queuing up, having your items scanned by a cashier, but before you can pay, the cashier starts serving the next person in the queue as soon as they arrive – then, if all the items you’re trying to buy sell out in the meantime, you’re not allowed to buy the item anymore and leave the shop empty handed.

A crashed website means you’re not moving any stock whatsoever, and it’s left sitting in your warehouse, even where there is plenty of demand.

According to the man who built the system (and Intechnica co-founder) Andy Still, “Under testing, the system used for 2005′s Glastonbury ticket sales was capable of selling 100,000 tickets in under a minute, but we throttled it to give people a wider window to buy their tickets in the interest of fairness.&quot;

This dramatically limits the number of people who can actually make use of the superfast speeds “on the go&quot;.

                    <text>Recently, eBay warned that the lack of speedy mobile shopping experiences could cost the UK economy £120m this Christmasaccording to an article on internetretailing.net , and this could have been avoided by more widespread 4G coverage and adoption – but is 4G really the “magic bullet&quot; to cure sluggish, unresponsive online shopping experiences?

                    <text>Retailers see increased network speeds as an opportunity to add more elements to pages, particularly on mobiles and tablets.
But this doesn’t necessarily match up with the public’s expectations with site speed – the top barriers to mobile shopping success will still be down to speed and reliability.

                    <text>Retailers should not make the mistake of waiting for 4G to solve the speed issue for them – they can see significant results right now, from desktop through to mobile site performance.
A one second page delay can cause a 7% reduction on conversion rates, so taking a serious look at your site’s performance is well worthwhile.

                    <text>Leave a Comment September 19, 2012 How (and Why) NOT to Crash Your Servers I recently came across a blog post on iMedia Connection titled “How to Crash Your Servers: 4 Key Elements to Driving Traffic “.
This struck me as a strange title; after all, who would actually WANT to crash their own servers?

                    <text>Well, I suppose the title worked because I clicked and I read the post.
But as the title hints, the article opens with the “attractive&quot; proposition of creating a marketing campaign so effective that it crashes the target website.
In fact, here’s a direct quote:

                    <text>* The last thing your business should want to happen is for your website to crash or suffer performance problems.This is not a good thing! * The worst possible time to direct people towards your website or landing page is when your website is down or at a crawl.It’s a waste of time and effort and annoys potential customers!
Here’s another quote from the article: “It’s every internet marketers dream to crash the servers.&quot; 
While it might seem like a great indicator of success that a marketing campaign has generated so much traffic that it “crashed the servers&quot;, here’s the bad news: by sending more traffic at your site than the site could handle,you’ve just wasted your marketing campaign, since nobody can take advantage of your special offer or read about your business now that the site is unavailable.

                <section>
                    <text>Think about it: If you were a potential customer and you saw an offer online that you wanted to take advantage of, or an advert or link to a product or service that might be of genuine interest to you, how would you feel if you clicked that link only to sit looking at a loading screen for several minutes, or if the page just never loaded at all?
MAYBE you would try again later.
But you’re more likely to never come back – 88% of users don’t return to websites after a poor experience (source:Gomez ).

                    <text>This also softens the impact of any future marketing campaigns you do.
I think the most key fact to mention, though, is thata crashed website has a conversion rate of zero.
Guaranteed.

                    <text>I’m not saying you should be conservative with your marketing campaigns in fear of bringing the website down.
Instead, you need to know that your website will be able to handle the traffic brought in by marketing streams, before the campaign starts.
By undertaking a performance audit withIntechnica , you can get assurance on exactly how much traffic your website can handle (see Janrain’s blog about their story ), as well as where any performance problems might exist.

                    <text>Leave a Comment September 17, 2012 Specification by Example: Tooling Recommendations Specification by example has a history that is closely linked to Ruby.
The main software tools and development methods came from work on Ruby projects.
As the method has started to attract a wider audience development tools and links to Microsoft .Net platforms have begun to appear.

                    <text>At Intechnica our approach has been from two directions.
An important aspect of the methodology is the use of continuous integration and code build, and that unit tests and inter-module testing is built into the software framework.
This will prove that the code providing the functionality for the stories is working properly.

                    <text>So the development teams are looking to build continuous integration and unit tests into their software development processes.
At the same time we don’t want to be tied to a specific and expensive development platform.
Current processes are predicated on using Team Foundation Server – if the testing components are added to this it becomes an expensive solution.

It is no good having meetings and having working groups and then finding that they can only print output and can’t have shared input.
The solution we have chosen isMindmeister.

                    <text>Like many tools used for business analysis, testing and development,Mindmeister  is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution.
This provides great flexibility and reduces the need to have software installed onto closed PCs or to use licensing dongles and allows easier upgrades.
The software is free to use with limited number of mindmaps in the basic version; the personal version with greater number of maps and export formats is £4.99 a month, and the pro version is £9.99.

                    <text>Once the project has a satisfactory outline and the scope has been captured with a rough outline of the solution we then use theSpeclog solution to start to write the user stories.Speclog is a tool that is designed to look at business requirements and allow them to be described fully.
For the story based process of specification by example this allows us to breakdown an application into its constituent actor goals, business goals and user stories.
Each core feature is broken out into different user stories.

Linking back to specification by example, the output produced is in Gherkin language.

                    <text>This takes us back to our initial introduction to specification by example where we worked on user stories and used a Ruby tool calledCucumber that allowed the project to be detailed.
Cucumber also produced and validated Gherkin code.
It is a descriptive language that allows requirements to be described in the Given When Then format.

An order should have a valid product, reject certain types of product, have correct dispatch details, have a correct order scheme, contain shipping details, reject incorrect quantity amount and produce an order summary.
From this the Gherkin user stories would then be produced and the developer would start to work on the features that provide this software capability.

                <section>
                    <text>And this brings us to our last software tool.
In order that user stories can be discussed with the users and reviewed internally during development and testing, we need a tool that can bring together the Gherkin output in a Wiki style web site.
This is key to the specification by example method where the output needs to be the living documentation and reflect the improvements and changes that are made to the requirements and how they are met through the project.

                    <text>Most importantly, both the SpecLog description (connected to the development cycle) and the tool used to monitor the progress of the requirements and display their maturing needed to be closely aligned.
In theory this can be done by putting the Gherkin files into a version control system where the software that provides the capability will be developed, but because we don’t have the right connectivity and the development processes are not yet in place, we have put in a simpler solution.

                    <text>The user stories are being published into a file share and then put out into a Wiki style display tool calledRelish .
This can be used in two ways, directly by writing Gherkin feature files using simple editors such as Notepad++ or Sublime – plugins to these two products allow them to validate Gherkin code.

There will also be a much larger number of software modules and the relationship between the stories and the underlying code needs to be monitored.
This area will require a lot of detailing work.

Collaboration and flexibility are key – as is basic reliability.
A time can be seen when there is a end-to-end link up to take requirements and produce testable artefacts.

                    <text>The next step in the process will be to work out how the development tools will hook into this process and more importantly, if we can follow the process fully, is it possible to produce a hybrid approach that combines traditional methods with this much leaner approach?
The biggest challenge with this process is that it works from a top-down perspective – where traditional software methods use a combination of top-down and bottom-up to ensure that no gaps are inadvertently produced.
It is addressing this issue that will be the most pressing challenge for specification by example.

                    <text>The issue of Performance assurance is especially interesting from the perspective of SaaS users, since performance has such an effect on page views, user satisfaction, conversion rates, bounce rate etc. etc., and SaaS customers of course have no control over the infrastructure of the software they are using.
They must simply have faith that the SaaS product is going to perform, and that the providers have taken this into account.
This is a consideration that US based social login SaaS providerJanrain recently came to Intechnica to explore – they wanted to prove to themselves and the market that their hosted registration, social profile data collection and storage service could handle any load that a potential customer might throw at it.

And retailers – in the midst of thebusiness of shopping – often let marketing and customer-service opportunities slip through their fingers.
But this is an opportunity they cannot afford to squander: The competition to attract and retain customers is a growing challenge, so retailers must find ways to establish stronger customer ties and improve the shopping experience.

The success of such programs relies on how companies use and manage that data.
Many have spent years gathering information with few practical applications, hoping that technology would one day catch up with their needs and offer a way to turn data into dollars.

                    <text>That day is here.
IBM Global Business Services, IBM Research and IBM Retail Store Solutions teamed with Cuesol, an IBM Business Partner, to find a way to help turn customer information into useful, profitable action for a large retail grocery chain.
With more than 345 stores in the northeastern United States, the company was seeking to solidify its customer base and trigger incremental sales.

                    <text>Although the grocer already had an existing loyalty card program, it wanted a more precise, cost-effective way to reach customers – notafter they made their purchases, but during the decision-making process.
The company sought a solution that would allow customers to better manage their time in the store, help them navigate the aisles quickly and reduce wait times.
The grocer also wanted to hone its marketing efforts to reach shoppers with relevant, targeted promotions as they traversed the aisles.

                    <text>The system integrates with the company’s backend systems, so buying histories and favorite items can be displayed on the screen as a constant reminder of products to buy.
The device also lets shoppers order cold cuts from the deli, sending an alert when the order is ready.
An attached imaging scanner invites consumers to scan items as they place them in the cart, keeping a running total (of expenses and savings) along the way and completing their transaction using IBM self-checkout systems.

                    <text>Meanwhile, IBM Research is exploring ways to refine Personal Shopping Assistant technology with customer-sensitive features, such as suggesting a wine to go with a meal or providing dietary guidance on specific items.
Researchers see Shopping Buddy as a prime candidate for moving Web technology closer to the physical world, with, for example, ads targeted to individual consumers, based on prior purchases, in the precise environment where they are primed to make a purchase – just as camera ads show up on your computer screen when you query your search engine for camera.
IBM researchers also say the technology could be extended to other retailers and retail sectors.

To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple specific algorithm.

History The term was coined by Fanya Montalvo [citation needed ] by analogy with NP-complete and NP-hard in complexity theory , which formally describes the most famous class of difficult problems.[5]
Early uses of the term are in Erik Mueller's 1987 Ph.D. dissertation[6] and in Eric Raymond 's 1991 Jargon File .[7]

It must also model the authors' goals, intentions, and emotional states to accurately reproduce them in a new language.

Software brittleness Main article: Software brittleness AI systems can solve very simple restricted versions of AI-complete problems, but never in their full generality.
When AI researchers attempt to &quot;scale up&quot; their systems to handle more complicated, real world situations, the programs tend to become excessively brittle without commonsense knowledge or a rudimentary understanding of the situation: they fail as unexpected circumstances outside of its original problem context begin to appear.

                    <text>When human beings are dealing with new situations in the world, they are helped immensely by the fact that they know what to expect: they know what all things around them are, why they are there, what they are likely to do and so on.
They can recognize unusual situations and adjust accordingly.
A machine withoutstrong AI has no other skills to fall back on.[8]

Formalization Computational complexity theory deals with the relative computational difficulty ofcomputable functions .
By definition it does not cover problems whose solution are unknown or have not been characterised formally.
Since many AI problems have no formalisation yet, conventional complexity theory does not allow the definition of AI-completeness.

                    <text>To address this problem, a complexity theory for AI has been proposed.[9]
It is based on amodel of computation that splits the computational burden between a computer and a human: one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by human.
This is formalised by a human-assistedTuring machine .
The formalisation defines algorithm complexity, problem complexity and reducibility which in turn allowsequivalence classes to be defined.

                    <text>Sections: Basic percentage exercises , Markup / markdown, General increase / decrease An important category of percentage exercises is markup and markdown problems.
For these, you calculate the markup or markdown in absolute terms (you find by how much the quantity changed), and then you calculate the percent change relative to the original value.
So they're really just another form of &quot;increase - decrease&quot; exercises.

                    <text>* A shoe store uses a 40% markup on cost.
Find the cost of a pair of shoes that sells for$63.   ADVERTISEMENT   This problem is somewhat backwards.
They gave me the selling price, which is cost plus markup, and they gave me the markup rate, but they didn't tell me the actual cost or markup.
So I have to be clever to solve this.

Then the markup, being 40% of the cost, is 0.40x.
And the selling price of$63 is the sum of the cost and markup, so:

                    <text>* An item that regularly sells for $425 is marked down to $318.75.
What is the discount rate?
First, I'll find the amount of the markdown:

                    <text>425  318.75 = 106.25 Then I'll calculate &quot;the markdown over the original price&quot;, or the markdown rate:($106.25) is (some percent) of ($425), so:

This problem is backwards.

                    <text>They gave me the sale price ($127.46) and the markdown rate(15%), but neither the markdown amount nor the original price.
I will let &quot;x&quot; stand for the original price.
Then the markdown, being 15% of this price, was0.15x.
And the sale price is the original price, less the markdown, so I get:

You can save yourself some time if you think of discounts in this way: if the price is15% off, then you're only actually paying 85%.
Similarly, if the price is25% off, then you're paying 75%; if the price is 30% off, then you're paying70%; and so on.

                    <text>119 Comments 0 5 Google has never been a design-forward company, revolutionizing our lives through interface design.
Instead, they’ve taken over the world building products with raw intellectual horsepower--brilliant artificial intelligence to fuel search, wise mapping systems to take us from point A to point B, and clever cloud-syncing apps that allow us to collaborate on projects from around the globe.
Google never had to be pretty.
It’s always been smart.

It’s called Project Glass, and it’s a pair of glasses that layers digital information over the real world.

But maybe most notably, nothing about what Google has presented is an actual product yet, or considered close to finalized. “We wanted to let people know about what we’re doing, and what we hope to achieve with it,&quot; a Google spokesperson told Co.Design, “But in terms of the graphics, the visuals, the hardware setup, there’s a lot of experimentation going on.
And a lot of rapid prototyping on the team.&quot;

Now that this concept is public, Google will be entering what they called the “feedback gathering phase,&quot; in which they’re looking for the community to chime in on what they want to see (and don’t want to see) in a fully realized product.

And, for lack of a better term, we’ll call it The Segway Problem.

                    <text>Technology can be a symbol of your future-forwardness, or it can be the exact opposite: a sign of the future’s ridiculousness.
The Segway flopped in part for its cost and in part for the fact that humanity isn’t quite that lazy, but there was a deeper, visceral reaction to the core of the product that signified a silly future rather than an inspiring one.

                    <text>So far, the actual glasses Google is showing off aren’t inspiring.
To succeed, Google will need to sell us on either the stylishness, or the invisibility, of video glasses.
And may we suggest copying the iPod in this approach?
Make the technology as obscured on the user as possible, except for one trademark calling card (in the iPod’s case, white earbuds).

                    <text>As inspiring as moments in Google’s concept video may be--and the photo-taking moment is an aha moment if I’ve ever seen one--it’s also stuffed with notification, none of which is fundamentally different from what we could be checking on our cell phones less intrusively.
The functions that Google blocks will be as integral to the platform’s success as those that are enabled.

                    <text>Finding the perfect level of obtrusiveness within an omnipresent Internet connection could be the largest challenge of human-device interaction the electronics industry has ever encountered.
And as Google is paving new ground, they’re working outside their comfort zone: Google has no data to mine for how much notification is too much notification.
If ever there’s been a product ripe for Google Labs field testing, it’s Project Glass.

                    <text>3. Google Needs To Find A Killer Use-Case People in the Valley used to talk all the time about finding &quot;killer apps&quot;--that is, the one, defining use of a technology that’ll spark its mass adoption.
And no wonder: With technologies such as augmented reality and Project Glass, the possibilites seem to outstrip the actual need.
As I suggested before, these glasses aren’t yet doing anything our phones can’t.
So why do they need to be glasses?

                    <text>Well, it turns out, people didn’tneed another computer so much as they wanted one--a computer that would make surfing the web from your bed or couch a lot less clunky and more fun.
With Project Glass, I’m not sure that they have that use-case yet--that is, the perfect scenario where this just makes sense in people’s lives.
There might be some set of features and interactions that makes it so, but these haven’t quite appeared just yet.

                    <text>Where Project Glass is at now, what one spokesperson labeled “the feedback gathering phase&quot; in our brief conversation today, is a tenuous spot to be in.
Crowdsourcing can create great products, but when it comes to inventing something that no one has conceptualized before, we need bold visionaries, not naysaying Internet whiners.
Not just anyone can design a user interface.

                    <text>And I’d posit that almost no one can design a usable interface that will sit in our eyeballs 24/7.
Crowdsourcing user feedback at the invisible level--the advanced A/B testing Google does when they test the color blue without us even knowing it--could be integral to fine tuning Project Glass at a number of levels.
But at heart, they will need to present us with a most singular vision if they expect any of us to don a pair of glasses, not a mishmash of suggestions from the peanut gallery.

The little things, the softest touches of design, will define Project Glass’s future in the marketplace.
Is the interface loud or quiet?
Do we use vocal commands with some functions or all functions?
Are notifications really in the center of the screen, or can they be repositioned?

                    <text>Will images be opaque or partially transparent?
What will the glasses show when I sit at my computer or when I drive?
All of these “how does it feel&quot; components will matter even more than they do in a cell phone.
But on top of all this, and maybe most importantly, we’ll need to know the one big reason that we’ll all want to wear our phones rather than keep them tucked away in our pockets.
As of right now, I don’t think we’ve seen it.

                    <text>Most of us interact with at least one Google product every day.
Many of us use their products all day, every day.
Whether or not you’ve been particularly inspired by their design, you can’t argue that their approach hasn’t worked well enough so far.

                    <text>But it’s been a while since Google was the first to market in uncharted territory (and it begs the question, have they ever been, really?).
Wearing a computer has the potential to redefine the human experience even more than PCs or smartphones did.
With Project Glass, Google has the task of designing the interface of our lives, and I can’t imagine a greater challenge ahead of them.
