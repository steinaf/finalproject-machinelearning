No one knows whether it will last, but Americans are shopping. Retail sales 
growth has continued for 15 consecutive months, and the National Retail 
Federation projects growth of 3.4 percent in 2012.

Those who are rooting for the economy to break out of what has been a 
sluggish few years hope the optimistic projections are accurate, but economists 
and retailers predict that 2012 will be another challenging year.

Retailers say they plan to focus on their customers and on their merchandise 
this year while trying to overcome a litany of challenges. Here are the 
most serious ones.

Struggling along with the economy

Like every other industry, retail is up against a fragile economy, with slow 
growth forecast for well into the first half of 2012. The good news is that the 
unemployment  rate has been 
decreasing, and consumers have begun dipping into their savings to spend: a 
sign that either consumer confidence is rising or that they just want to reward 
themselves for saving so aggressively the past few years.

But food-service retailers and others point out that the increased cost of 
commodities, everything from coffee to bread to paper products, is problematic.

“It’s a huge challenge to communicate cost increases to our customers and 
even to our staff,” says Don Pratt, owner of the Aromas 
 coffee shops in southeast 
Virginia. “If Ghiardelli, one of our vendors in San Francisco, has to pay more 
for cocoa products, so will we. We need to find out how to let our customers
know that.”

Staging stores

Everyone knows online shopping is more popular than ever, but 
brick-and-mortar stores still dominate, and retailers say they need to make 
their stores more attractive to people who are perfectly satisfied shopping 
online. Retailers say their stores need to become destinations, like Starbucks, 
where people like to spend time.

“It’s so easy to shop online that stores need to step up their game and make 
me want to be there,” says Amy Lin, a mother of two in suburban New York City.
“If they don’t do that, I won’t want to spend as much of my time shopping the 
old-fashioned way, and I’ll shop more sitting in front of my computer.”

Analyzing data

Retailers have never had more information about their customers, but many are 
struggling to figure out what it all means. In a recent survey by Accenture, 72 
percent of 258 North American business leaders said they plan to spend more on 
analytics . In many cases that 
means buying software and hiring analysts to make sense of streams of data 
coming from mobile devices and other electronics.

Figuring out the potential of mobile devices

More and more consumers are using smartphones 
, tablets and other mobile 
devices to make purchases, find coupons and learn where they can get the best 
deals. These days, shoppers might be browsing in your store but using their 
smartphones to check your competitors’ prices. Retailers say determining how to 
best take advantage of this technology is a tricky puzzle they must solve.

Embracing social media

Facebook  and Walmart 
 struck a deal that will allow 
shoppers to better connect with the chain’s stores. Expect other retailers to 
follow suit. According to Booz Allen Hamilton, $30 billion will be spent via 
social commerce by 2015. Retailers need to figure out the best way to use 
Facebook, YouTube , Twitter 
 and other social media 
 to its advantage, spending 
wisely and not just throwing money at it.

“Look at Groupon,” Pratt says. “Throwing coupons out there to hundreds or 
thousands of people and hoping they come in can impact us negatively as well as 
positively. Groupon can put you out of business. It can be dangerous.”

HR Challenges in the Retail Sector

by Neil Kokemuller, Demand Media  

Each employee has a big role in a small retail environment.

Sky View/Photodisc/Getty Images

Human resources involves the strategic planning and management of employees 
to create a productive and motivated workforce. The retail industry poses 
particular HR challenges because employees deal directly with your customers. 
You must consider both short-term and long-term HR objectives when addressing 
these challenges.

High Turnover

Retail is notorious for having a high rate of employee turnover. This means 
employees routinely come and go, which poses several challenges. Training and 
developing are difficult, time consuming and constant if you constantly have to 
recruit and hire new people. It's also more difficult to build customer loyalty 
if customers keep seeing a new face every time they enter your store. You can 
address these problems by recruiting the right people and building a rapport 
with your employees. When you interview people, make sure you ask specific 
questions that relate to the type of work your employees do. Informal social 
outings and fun games at work can help build rapport.

Diversity

A diverse workforce is typically regarded as a good thing. It helps a 
retailer better connect with its marketplace and usually leads to more and 
better ideas and results. However, a staff of people from widely varying 
demographic backgrounds might have trouble developing cohesiveness. From an HR 
vantage point, your challenge is to manage diversity to avoid major conflicts 
and promote a spirit of tolerance, teamwork and collaboration. Include 
diversity discussions in store meetings and encourage employees to discuss 
their differences. These techniques can go a long way toward building a more 
cohesive team.

Misconceptions

To build a staff of competent, committed and motivated employees, retailers 
must overcome a number of common challenges and misconceptions about the work 
environment. Common concerns include long hours, no full-time jobs or benefits, 
low pay and no growth opportunities. You can overcome these challenges by going 
against the industry grain. Offer regular eight-hour work shifts at your retail 
business. Provide competitive pay and benefits to full-time employees. Even if 
your starting pay is modest, do your best to offer fast tracks to higher 
salaries and management positions when an employee has established a good track 
record with your business.

Seasonal Demand

Retailers often experience seasonal demand fluctuations. The holiday buying 
season, from "Black Friday" through Christmas, is well-known as the busiest 
shopping season of the year. Retailers often try to add temporary staff during 
these times. They often wind up with fewer skilled and trained workers who 
might not have the tools to best serve your customers. These workers can also 
alienate regular staff that must pick up the slack. Develop a plan to 
assimilate temporary workers during these seasonal periods. A store meeting at 
the start of the busy season is a good way to help temporary workers learn the 
system and get to know the regular staff.

 Retailing is big business. That is, 
if$4 trillion a year impresses you. Big-box and franchise stores get a chunk of 
that, but a significant—and growing—percentage is done by small, independent 
retail stores that sell everything from abaci to zithers. The owners, typically 
one or two people who love what they sell, make a good living and enjoy their 
lives. Independent retail stores are lifestyle businesses. Maybe it's a 
lifestyle foryou.

The problem is that so many business books are written for folks with loads 
of cash or credit, and they focus primarily on the profit side of business. 
Financial profit is vital to staying in business, but it isn't theonly reason 
to open a store. There are many types of retailing rewards, and not all of them 
have a price tag. Most small business books don't cover the other reasons for 
retailing. They don't see the other side of owning your store: helping 
customers fulfill their needs, giving employees a living wage, and building 
your community.

The Everything® Guide to Starting and Running a Retail Store is written by 
lifestyle retailers for readers who are considering their own stores. 
Candidates have lots of questions. What can they profitably sell? What are the 
start-up costs? How much will their store make? How can it serve both the 
customers and the owner(s)? Should they sell online? How can a small retailer 
ever compete with the big-box stores like Wal-Mart, Target, and all the others 
that seemingly have everything in the world at low prices? These and hundreds 
of other questions are answered for you in this book.

There are many types of independent retail stores. All face about the same 
problems as they set up and operate. Chapters 1 through 4 will help you plan 
for retail success. Chapters 5 through 13 tell you what you need to know about 
starting your retail store. Chapters 14 through 17 offer specifics on running 
your store day-to-day. Chapters 18 through 22 show you how to build and, if you 
desire, eventually sell your store. Along the way you'll learn how to use 
technology to compete with big stores and how to increase profits with online 
sales. The appendices include retailing resources and a comprehensive glossary 
of retailing terms. The authors suggest that you read through the entire book 
before making a full commitment to retailing, then read it again once your 
store has begun and is growing.

To clarify basic business principles, the authors use Bob's Widgets as an 
example retailer. You'll see Bob's business plan and watch him start and run 
his store with practical tips and advice. In addition, sidebars offer 
additional information that you can put to work right now as you plan your own 
store. The sidebars include E-Fact (facts and statistics), E-Alert (cautions), 
E-ssential (tips), and E-Question (questions and answers), written to clarify 
and expand retailing basics.

Maybe lifestyle retailing is exactly what you're looking for. Maybe not. This 
book will help you make that decision based on real-world information and 
advice developed by experienced lifestyle retailers.

Interview Details – Extensive "behavioral" interview. They ask questions that 
require you to provide an example (of a time when...), what you did (or how you 
reacted), and the outcome. Prepare a lot of great examples of times when you 
overcame objections, dealt with difficult people, were given a project you were 
the 'leader' of, and the like. They absolutely do not want generalizations, 
like, "what I like to do when someone objects to a service I am offering is.." 
but rather, "I had a customer that said they did not want to spend any more 
money than what it was going to cost for x item..(example of a time..). I 
realized that I failed to provide a great enough value, and this gentleman 
happened to work at x company, and explained to him how much time it would save 
him to get this as well (what you did to overcome it), he decided to get it. I 
made the company a little bit more money and got more money toward my sales 
quota (the outcome)!

Minnesota    Like retailers of 
past, Best Buy will have to adapt to survive

    By Louis D. Johnston 
 | 04/12/12 Like retailers of 
past, Best Buy will have to adapt to survive

Best Buy CEO Brian Dunn’s highly publicized departure this week has prompted 
a flood of speculation about the future of the company – and about the end of 
retailing as we know it.

Although Best Buy’s fall – reporting declines 
 in 
same-store sales in six of the past seven quarters – may seem abrupt, even 
stunning, the company and other brick-and-mortar chains are facing the same 
question that mass retailers faced over the last 100 years: How do they evolve 
from their beginnings into something new that meets today’s needs and 
challenges?

To better understand those challenges, it’s helpful to examine the roots of 
mass retailing and how retailers have responded to changing markets in the past.

Cars, trucks and shopping malls

Mass retailing grew up between 1880 and 1920, as I described in last week’s 
column 

. Department stores, mail-order houses, and chain stores utilized the railroad 
and telegraph/telephone networks to create high-volume, low-margin businesses 
that sold everything from razor blades to furniture.

Then, automobile ownership and the development of trucking changed the retail 
environment in the 1920s.  Customers could drive themselves to stores instead 
of waiting for packages in the mail. Suppliers were no longer limited to 
railroad lines; they could now ship goods anywhere trucks travelled. The 
advantages of department stores in urban centers served by public 
transportation and mail-order houses that served rural areas eroded as chain 
stores took advantage of the new transportation realities.

Mail-order houses reacted first; they saw their business drop as customers 
drove themselves to chain stores.  So Sears, the largest mail-order house, 
moved rapidly to create chain stores of their own in fast-growing suburban 
areas and small towns. For instance, in 1928 Sears opened one of its largest 
stores at Chicago and Lake in Minneapolis (it’s now the site of the Midtown 
Global Market and the Midtown Exchange building).

lakesnwoods.comIn 1928 Sears opened one of its largest stores at Chicago and 
Lake in Minneapolis.Department stores also started branching out and creating 
small chains, but the growth of suburbs posed a problem for them (as well as 
for Sears and other chains): Where do we put our stores?  Cities had clearly 
defined downtowns and neighborhoods, but suburbs often lacked an obvious 
business center.

The solution was the shopping center. The first iterations were what we would 
call strip malls, that is, groups of stores each with its own entrance facing a 
central parking lot.Knollwood Plaza 
 in St. Louis Park  is a 
good example of this early model: a Powers department store anchored one end of 
the project while chain stores filled the rest of the complex.

Courtesy of the Minnesota Historical SocietyKnollwood Plaza in St. Louis Park 
was one of the first strip malls.Shopping centers were fine, but walking from 
the car to a store on a winter day and then going from store to store in the 
cold discouraged shoppers from lingering.  So, reported The New York Times on 
Oct. 9, 1956, “The first weather-conditioned shopping center opened in Edina, 
Minn.,” the previous day. This, of course, was Southdale Center, the next step 
in retail evolution. Store entrances faced an enclosed central courtyard 
instead of facing the parking lots. Shoppers could park their cars and then 
stroll in climate-controlled comfort from store to store.

Courtesy of the Minnesota Historical SocietySouthdale Center, which opened in 
1956, was the first indoor suburban shopping mall.Big boxes

How could stand-alone department stores, mail-order houses and chain stores 
compete with these new shopping centers? This was the question they faced in 
the 1950s and 1960s as shopping centers spread across the land. Department 
stores like Dayton’s and mail-order houses  like Sears embraced the malls, 
becoming the prime developers of shopping centers. Chain stores such as 
Woolworth’s, Kinney Shoes and Ben Franklin also decided it was best to locate 
in the malls.

Others looked at the problem differently. S. S. Kresge Corporation operated a 
large chain similar to Woolworth’s. During the 1950s Kresge put stores in 
shopping centers, but then decided that a better way to go was to build 
stand-alone stores with acres of parking. Their first K-Mart opened in Garden 
City, Mich., in 1962, and by the early 1970s Kresge was opening 100 new stores 
a year.

Two competitors watched Kresge’s experiment with great interest. One was the 
owner of a Ben Franklin franchise in Arkansas, Sam Walton. Wal-Mart was in many 
ways a copy of the K-Mart concept, but with a significant difference: While 
K-Mart kept large stocks both on the sales floor and in backrooms, Walton opted 
to keep as little inventory as possible in the stores. Walton’s aim was to 
speed up the rate at which goods moved into and out of the stores, thus 
minimizing inventory costs.

The other observer was the Dayton Corporation, which developed Southdale and 
owned Dayton’s department stores. Dayton noted that both K-Mart and Wal-Mart 
concentrated on low-priced merchandise aimed at blue-collar urban and suburban 
families (K-Mart) or low-income rural and small-town customers (Wal-Mart). Why 
not create something that catered to middle-income suburban families? The 
result was Target.

From the 1970s through the 2000s the big boxes evolved further, and Best Buy 
was a prime example of this trend. Chains took the idea of large, free-standing 
stores with plenty of parking and then focused their merchandise on items such 
as electronics (Best Buy, Circuit City), housewares (Bed, Bath and Beyond, 
Linens and Things), home improvement (Home Depot, Menards) and eventually books 
(Barnes and Noble, Borders).

Facing the future

What’s next?  How will Best Buy and other brick-and-mortar chains evolve to 
meet the next set of challenges?

The test for department stores, mail-order houses and chain stores was 
suburbanization driven by the automobile. Some companies survived and thrived: 
Dayton Corporation eventually shed its department stores and embraced its new 
identity as Target Corporation. Others, such as Sears and S. S. Kresge, 
embraced the mall and the big box and did well for decades but now struggle to 
survive. Woolworth’s, Montgomery Ward, Ben Franklin and local chains such as 
Gamble’s didn’t even make it past the 1980s.

Online retailing is the new challenge to existing retailers. Will they evolve 
and grow like Dayton’s? Will they stumble and limp along like Sears and K-Mart? 
Or will they die like Woolworth’s? 

The answer will come, I believe, by applying some basic economics. In 
particular, economic theory postulates that firms are collections of objects 
(labor, capital, natural resources) and ideas (recipes for managing these 
resources and producing goods and services). And, just as importantly, 
companies exist to make the best use of these objects and ideasregardless of 
what they produced in the past. Perhaps retailers, specifically, and 
businesses, more generally, should actually do this – at least the ones that 
want to survive.

Carlson Companies is a good example of a survivor. Remember Gold Bond Stamps? 
That’s how Curt Carlson built the business: grocery shoppers received Gold Bond 
Stamps when they shopped, then saved up stamps to buy merchandise. Carlson 
built warehouses for merchandise and stores where customers could redeem their 
stamps. (My parents bought my first bike with Gold Bond Stamps.)

However, by the 1960s grocery shoppers started to prefer lower prices to 
premiums such as stamps. Carlson could have tried to keep this business going, 
but he didn’t. He looked at his people, his capital and his company’s knowledge 
of retail and used those objects and ideas to move into hotels, restaurants and 
travel agencies. By the early 1980s, Gold Bond Stamps were gone, but Carlson 
Companies continued to grow and thrive as a hospitality firm.

Best Buy and other brick-and-mortar retailers must ask the same question. 
What do we do? If the answer is simply “sell stuff,” then they are dead. 
Internet retailers can do this far more cheaply and quickly. But if they look 
closely at the talents of their people and the capital they have available to 
them, and then answer a key question — “How can we best use these resources?” — 
they can grow into businesses we can’t even imagine today.

different ages of retailing is the McMaster-Carr company out of Chicago, IL. 
They are a business that sells industrial products. We get a new print catalog 
with item descriptions and current pricing every few months. The current print 
catalog is almost 4,000 pages, has close to 500,000 items and they are able to 
ship 98% of the items same day. WOW!! We order a product today, and it'll be at 
our business before noon the next day. You can call them, or place your order 
on-line. (If you have an account with them, it just takes seconds to get an 
order placed via phone). It just amazes me each time I deal with them on their 
service and product availability (and a print catalog, too!).

I may sound like a shill for them, but I am really impressed by their entire 
operation. That is retail done right!! It was Amazon when Amazon was still a 
South American river.

 Submitted by Hiram Foster  on 
April 12, 2012 - 10:47am. Curt Carlson's answer to the question, "how to 
survive a failing business?" was to get out of the business. My guess is that 
in his switch to the hospitality and restaurant business, the focus really 
wasn't so much on the talents of his employees in the stamp business. Best Buy 
may well transform itself. But into what? Is what Carlson did, move into the 
hospitality industry, really an attractive option for Best Buy?

 Submitted by Steve Titterud  
on April 12, 2012 - 6:24pm. ...perhaps its problems would not be so advanced at 
this time.

I find the absence of the CUSTOMER in the statement 

"...economic theory postulates that firms are collections of objects (labor, 
capital, natural resources) and ideas (recipes for managing these resources and 
producing goods and services). "

curious indeed.

Best Buy could convert - close substantial #s of its stores and change their 
function, but when bringing its perception of its customers to the online space 
- it would get killed by those online retailers who respect their customers and 
place a high value on their satisfaction. It's not just price.

 Accepted Offer – Interviewed in Fort Collins, CO May 2008  – Reviewed  Oct 
17, 2012 

Interview Details – Every interview is conducted using the STAR format, which 
is a behavioral based question format. ST = the situation/task, A = the action 
you took, and R = the result or outcome. They want you to be very specific and 
do not generalize - pick a specific scenario from your past and cover all 3 of 
the above topics. The inability to follow the guidelines is an easy way to weed 
out candidates.

This is how I was interviewed and it was very easy once I understood what they 
were looking for. The saying is, "past behavior predicts future performance". 
They want to know what you did in the past because you will probably do the 
same thing in the future, so be careful about the scenarios you choose to 
include. 

Interview Question – "Often times we are faced with customers with 
unreasonable demands. What is the most difficult customer interaction you have 
ever dealt with? How did you handle the situation and what was the result?"

Negotiation Details – I tried to negotiate a higher base salary, but was

Interview Details – It was a phone interview with a recruiter whose questions 
were mainly based around past experience situations rather than "how would you 
handle" type of questions. Some questions were, "give a situation where a 
direct report (subordinate) disagreed with your management style" or "A time 
you needed to make an on the spot leadership decision and what was the 
outcome". Generally it was a pleasant experience, not a-lot of pressure and 
recruits seemed down to earth and friendly.

Retail's Two Worlds: Tips on Integrating Online and Offline Channels Retailers 
are in transition as they balance customer experience in the store and on the 
Web. By Colin Beasty

When Kristen Sontos and her fiance began searching Wal-Mart's Web site, they 
were unaware that the entertainment system they chose couldn't be purchased in 
the store. The retailing giant failed to notify them of this on the Web. 
Kristen wanted to purchase the item in the store to avoid the $50 shipping 
charges. One hour and five dollars' worth of gas later, the third Wal-Mart they 
visited finally informed them that entertainment systems aren't carried in the 
store. "It was frustrating," she says. "We wasted a lot of time and ended up 
paying the shipping charges anyway. The dagger in the back was, when they 
finally shipped it to us, we were away on vacation. We ended up getting it a 
few weeks later."

Kristen's example highlights the reality many retailers are now facing in the 
Internet-shopping world. The emergence of online shopping is forcing companies 
to reconsider the business practices and technology they use to manage customer 
experience in the store and on the Web. More important, it's forcing retailers 
to think of them as one. "Integrating online and offline channels is something 
that's very much on the minds of retailers, and [is] forcing them to understand 
how to manage relationships across multiple channels, thanks to the emergence 
of the online shopper," says Mark Rein, senior manager at CapGemini. "From a 
CRM perspective, they need to understand who their customers are, understand 
their behavior, and execute seamlessly across those channels."

 Currently, there are three main channels through which a customer can 
purchase an item: in the store, through a catalog, or via a Web site. Of these, 
online retailing is without question the fastest growing method. According to 
Forrester Research, online retail sales are expected to increase from $172 
billion in 2005 to $329 billion in 2010, a 14 percent compound annual growth 
rate over the next five years. In addition, the average Web buyer earns more 
(with a household income of roughly $68,000 versus $52,000 for all consumers), 
is more likely to have a college degree, and is more likely to have purchased 
an item in the past three months across all product categories, according to 
Forrester. "As online retail continues into its second decade, business 
strategies that were once perceived as too complicated to integrate 
successfully, like CRM programs and multichannel integration, are now becoming 
commonplace," says Sucharita Mulpuru, senior analyst at Forrester. "E-commerce 
retailers are up and running. Now, it's a matter of honing and refining a lot 
of what they already know."

Ironing Out the Wrinkles
Retailers face a multitude of problems when it comes to integrating their 
online and offline channels. Of those problems, matching the prices and 
products found on their Web site to those found in the store has been a dilemma 
since the birth of online shopping. Nothing frustrates a consumer more than not 
finding the same DVD player in the store that he found online, or finding it at 
a different price. The reason for this is market pressure. Retailers compete 
regionally and nationally on prices and products. They must cater to regional 
consumers' wants--people in Washington don't purchase the same products that 
people in Florida do. The advent of retail Web sites has only complicated the 
matter.

David Z shoe stores are only located in New York, but the company's Web site 
can be accessed by anyone with an Internet connection. In a nutshell, 
regionalized pricing and inventory management, combined with regional 
competitors, are the main reason consumers find different prices on a 
retailer's Web site than in the store.

This problem crops up more in markets where consumer purchasing is based 
primarily on price. Take the consumer electronics market as an example. A 
PlayStation is a PlayStation no matter where you purchase it, but saving $20 
makes a big difference to customers. "A few years ago, Circuit City was a good 
example of this. They gave one price online, another price in their ad, and a 
different price in the store, all for the same item, without any explanation as 
to why," Rein says. "Simply stated, that's a great way to confuse and frustrate 
customers."

Remember the old days when you leafed through a clothing catalog, filled out 
an order form, and then mailed in a check and received the pair of pants you 
had ordered two weeks later? Times have changed. Catalogs have lost some ground 
in recent years to the Internet as the principal channel after in-store 
purchasing, although catalogs still serve an important function in today's 
retail market--consumers are using catalogs more for shopping, but less for 
buying. Purchasing takes place in the store or online. However, while catalogs 
no longer drive sales like they used to, they do drive sales in other channels. 
The problem is, retailers are failing to realize this. If a company is spending 
$100 million a year on catalogs, but direct sales into the call centers are 
declining at a rate of 10 to 15 percent, the immediate reaction is to cut 
spending on the catalog. This is a mistake, Rein says, because chances are that 
online sales will have increased 10 to 15 percent during the same time period. 
Fashion retailers deal with this issue the most, but any company that uses 
mail-order catalogs can encounter it. The problem is attributable to retailers 
failing to understand the cross-channel purchasing behaviors of consumers and 
an inability to track a customer's purchasing behavior after receiving a 
catalog. "You need to understand the timing of what catalogs you send to what 
customers, and how that's going to influence their purchasing habits," Rein 
says.

There's no doubt that price is a big motivator for multichannel shoppers. A 
Forrester report, "Trends 2006: Online Retail," states that 68 percent of 
multichannel shoppers say they buy online because the price is lower than in 
the store. From a competitive standpoint, retailers are now dealing with online 
discounters, such as pricegrabber.com and pricewatch.com, which make their 
money by underselling the retailers' own Web sites. Unfortunately for 
brick-and-mortar retailers, consumers can go to a Best Buy to try out the 
latest Xbox 360, or hit Macy's to look at the new spring fashion lineup from 
Calvin Klein, but they can purchase these items from a competing online broker 
at a significant discount. This discounting threat doesn't have to come from 
the Internet, either. Wal-Mart is notorious for engaging in competitive pricing 
and underselling regional merchants.

A common, and unfortunate, response to these competitors is to lower prices. 
"A lot of retailers are caught in the mania of '99. They feel they need to 
extend an offer at the drop of a hat to drive sales. Those that do are slipping 
through a downward spiral of decay," says Mulpuru. The question for retailers 
then becomes this: What value are they giving the consumer other than price? 
"If price isn't your differentiating value, your customers are shopping at your 
store or at your Web site because you're adding value to their experience [in a 
way] that goes beyond saving money," Rein says.

That's where integrating online and offline channels can help. From a service 
perspective, many retailers are only beginning to integrate their online 
channels with their call centers. Most retailers that have both an online 
retail site and a phone-based catalog have failed to, or are just beginning to, 
integrate the two. A consumer can spend hours surfing a company's Web site, 
then call the catalog phone number with a question, only to discover the 
catalog call center has no knowledge of the shopper's presence or activities on 
the Web. Nor does it have any online transaction history for the customer. The 
same applies to interacting with the customer service desk at the store. Almost 
always, the assistant behind the desk has no access to transaction history at 
that store or on the Web. It is primarily a technology problem. "Most retailers 
aren't connected from the standpoint of an integrated customer profile," says 
Mark Singer, a director, focusing on CRM strategies, at McKinsey & Company. 
"Companies that used to have strong phone channels before the Internet are 
pretty disconnected when it comes to integrating their online and offline 
channels. Here, integrating multiple channels via the customer database with a 
content management system is key."

What's more, retailers are finding it difficult to acquire customer 
information. In the old days, stores were able to capture customer data each 
time a consumer swiped his or her credit card. Today, for security reasons, 
many states are enacting laws that prevent this. As a result, retailers are 
being forced to rely on their Web sites. This bodes well for customers who 
purchase via the Web, but forgetting about in-store consumers is a problem many 
retailers are only beginning to cope with. "When a customer walks into the 
store, it's critical to connect with them other than on price alone," Rein 
says. "Online retailing is a great way to capture customer data, primarily 
because it feels more natural to give information online than it does face to 
face with a person. But when it comes to capturing data in the store, retailers 
have to work a little harder these days and be a bit more ingenious than they 
are online."

When Worlds Collide
Understanding how to create the best shopping experience both in the store and 
on the Web means understanding customers' cross-channel behaviors. Doing so 
lets retailers create a seamless operation of top-notch service and support 
across all channels. "Retailers need to understand who their customers are and 
how they act differently on the Web as opposed to in the store," Rein says. 
"They need to be able to recognize customers and the type of transactions they 
engage in, transactions that are based on which channel the customer is 
shopping in."

Generally speaking, informed customers are happy customers. Many times 
customers understand that retailers prefer to drive sales to the Web because 
it's a cheaper delivery model. So, if a customer asks a retail salesperson 
about product pricing or availability on the Web, be honest and make it easy 
for employees and customers to access this information. Again, the consumer 
electronics market is a good example. People don't simply purchase a computer 
or digital camera; they seek the highest quality at the best price. "Customers 
aren't stupid. If you have a sophisticated customer who understands that it's 
much cheaper to transact with you online than it is in the store, retailers can 
reward that customer with lower prices [online], but again, you must make sure 
that the consumer understands that," Rein says. "As long as the company does a 
good job of informing the customer that there are price and inventory 
differences between online and offline, it's fine," Rein says.

As product information should be shared across channels, so should customer 
information. The best way to do this is to share customer data from the Web 
with retail stores. Singer cites software vendors like Vignette that specialize 
in content management systems to accomplish this. These vendors provide 
out-of-the-box, role-based programs that let companies build portals to create, 
update, and manage customer information across multiple databases. "In many 
cases, you're just starting to see major retailers doing major overhauls of 
their Web sites that got built around the turn of the century," he says. "In 
these overhauls, they're integrating their customer databases via content 
management systems and creating more personalized Web interactions with 
personalization software. One reason newer retailers, such as Best Buy, have 
found so much success stems from the fact they realized the importance of this 
from the beginning. They built a six-lane highway right from the start, instead 
of expanding a four-lane highway years later."

Integrating online and offline channels also means integrating business 
operations. Progress was made in 2005 when retailers began selling and 
redeeming gift cards online, and giving consumers the opportunity to buy 
merchandise online, but pick it up in the store. In addition, many retailers 
are beginning to allow customers to return items they purchased on the Web in 
the store. Others are matching Web prices in stores, helping to overcome the 
quandaries of regionalized pricing. Shopper programs, such as discount cards 
and preferred customer cards, enable retailers to offer discounts and services 
that keep customers informed of discount specials or deals that can only be 
found in a catalog or on the Web site. These practices integrate the two 
channels, and have the further benefit of adding value to the shopping 
experience which, according to Rein, is the best way for retailers to compete 
with discount Web sites like pricegrabber.com. "Besides monitoring a 
pricegrabber.com to make sure that prices are within 2 to 3 percent of their 
lowest prices, retailers must identify what other value they can offer a 
customer based off of the types of products they sell. This can be a good 
return policy or the ability to try things out for the consumer electronics 
market or, in apparel, the ability to size and try things on, something you 
can't do when you purchase via the Web."

In-store shopping programs also overcome the problem of acquiring customer 
information when the consumer is in the store. Almost always, consumers must 
complete an application to enter a program. These discount cards also enable 
retailers to keep track of purchasing habits in the store. Many are now 
starting to use discount cards to record which items a person is buying when 
goods are scanned at checkout.

Last, retailers that have a strong understanding of cross-channel purchasing 
behaviors can exploit the advantages of catalogs. Last year, certain retailers 
began using online versions of print catalogs. It's an effective solution, but 
Rein says that to really gain an understanding of consumer behaviors, companies 
that use catalogs must track how their catalogs alter the behaviors of their 
customers. "Today, retailers send personalized catalogs to specific customers 
based off of prior purchases. If a company knows they sent catalog Y to 
customer Z, they can then track their purchases online and in the store using 
Web analytics and shopper programs. You can take that data and run it through 
segmentation tests, comparing purchasing data from those who received the 
catalog against those who did not. Only recently have we seen the really savvy 
retailers start to build this into their business practices."

Retailers will continue to develop the business processes associated with 
merging online and offline channels. New VoIP technology will enable customers 
to connect with a call center representative directly from the Web site. 
"Retailers will be able to provide links on their Web site that will connect 
consumers directly with CSRs with the click of a button, based off of what 
products they're currently viewing. But for now, merging online and offline 
channels is still more a business problem than it is a technological one."

THREE TIPS FOR INTEGRATION
1. Keep customers informed. Without question, the biggest problem associated 
with integrating online and offline retail channels is discrepancies in price 
and inventory between the store and Web site. Simply stated, retailers can't 
possibly maintain the same inventory in-store that they do on the Web. 
Fortunately, the answer is a simple, yet overlooked, solution. Keep the 
customer informed of differences between the store and the Web. Consumers are 
smart and will understand, not to mention appreciate, the retailer taking the 
time to notify them.

2. Add value. Improve the consumers' shopping experience any way possible 
outside of merely cutting them a good price. Friendly, easily accessible 
customer service, product expertise, and solid return or exchange policies 
across all customer channels create happy customers. Adding value to the 
shopping experience is one of the best ways to overcome competitors that rely 
solely on price.

3. Break down the silos. A staple of CRM strategy, this piece of advice also 
applies to integrating retail channels, though not from a technology 
standpoint. One of the biggest reasons retailers have struggled over the past 
decade to integrate is their failure to grasp the development of the 
multichannel consumer. Today, actions on the Web influence purchasing decisions 
in the store. Collect customer purchasing information in the store at checkout, 
on the Web, and through the catalog. Use segmentation campaigns to compare 
customers and gain a better understanding of how they interact with the 
company. Just as a goal of CRM is to gain a holistic view of the customer, a 
goal of any retailer should be to provide a holistic shopping experience across 
all channels.--C.B.

Phys.Org Mobile: Retailers face challenges with same-day delivery Retailers 
face challenges with same-day delivery

Oct 24, Technology/Business

 Retailers testing same-day delivery service may soon find that giving 
customers what they want as fast as they want it is trickier - and costlier - 
than they bargained for.

 In their scramble to keep pace with online giant Amazon.com Inc., Wal-Mart 
and eBay this month announced plans for same-daydelivery 
 in selected parts of the nation. Some analysts 
caution that same-day delivery - the latest holy grail for retailers - is a
financial risk  and logistical nightmare 
to almost anyone but the pizza parlor and the local florist.

 "It's incredibly hard to pull off, said Fiona Dias, chief strategy officer at 
ShopRunner, aWeb service  that coordinates 
shipping for retailers. "We haven't found a way to economically do same-day 
delivery."

 But a lineage of failed delivery services like Web- van, an online grocery 
business that became a legendary dot-com failure, hasn't deterred retailers 
from striving to satisfy the ever-higher demands of consumers who want instant 
gratification.

 "That's the Internet," said Stephen Baker, vice president of industry 
analysis at NPD Group. "We already get instant delivery of our music, our 
movies."

 Some purchases are still worth a stroll through the mall - luxury jeweler 
Tiffany & Co. isn't likely to send engagement rings same-day delivery, nor 
would customers want to give up the glitzy, Champagne-filled shopping 
experience. But the convenience of quick home delivery appeals to shoppers like 
Lyshone Griffin of Oakland, Calif. Standing outside that city's Wal-Mart last 
week, she said she would happily pay the extra money for same-day delivery of 
large furniture, such as a bed, that she needed urgently and couldn't pick up 
from a store herself.

 Amazon and Wal-Mart promise customers that for just a few dollars extra their 
online purchases will be dropped at their front door within hours of ordering - 
or in eBay's case, in less than an hour. After all, there's nothing quite as 
exciting as a knock at the door from UPS, holding the new flat-screen TV you 
ordered even before the charge appears on your credit card.

 But analysts note that packages will reach customers within a day only if 
companies have enough merchandise and enough stores and warehouses spread 
throughout a delivery area. The other snare that often trips up retailers, said 
Dias, is that they can't control the delivery. In some cases, the delivery guy 
may be a college student trying to earn a few extra bucks working as a contract 
driver for eBay.

 "It's not a same-day guarantee; it's a same-day maybe," Dias said. 

 EBay spokeswoman Lina Shustarovich said the company's goal is to deliver in 
an hour, "but we can't control for unusual circumstances." EBay does not offer 
concessions for late deliveries.

 Wal-Mart will use its own trucks and drivers in the San Francisco Bay Area, 
where the mega-retailer has had an online grocery delivery service under way 
since 2010, and will work with UPS in the other test cities.

 Then there's the cost, which may discourage both retailers and customers. 
Wal-Mart charges $10 for deliveries of any size, which Dias expects will cover 
less than half the cost of one order. eBay offers three free deliveries, after 
which customers are charged $5. Orders must be at least $25.

 "The math doesn't make sense," Dias said. "It only makes sense if the truck 
is full. It doesn't make sense if there's only one package."

 But for a few Wal-Mart customers in Oakland, Calif., the delivery fee is too 
expensive; they're watching every dollar. Unloading her bags from a cart 
outside the store, Maria Rivera of Alameda, Calif., said same-day delivery was 
"not for me." She doesn't have a computer at home to shop online, and even if 
she could borrow a friend's, the extra $10 was too much.

 Spokeswoman Ashley Hardie said the test would help Wal-Mart gauge where 
same-day delivery might work, and "learn what's better for our customers and 
better for our business."

 Even Amazon hasn't found a way around the high cost. Chief Financial Officer 
Thomas Szkutak said this year that same-day delivery on a broad scale is not 
economically feasible. The company began same-day delivery in 2009, but the 
service has been limited to a handful of cities. But Amazon also has been 
aggressively expanding other delivery services and building more warehouses - 
it now has a total of 40 in the U.S. to get merchandise to customers more 
quickly.

 Even Amazon's efforts to speed up deliveries likely won't sway Sunnyvale, 
Calif., resident Andrey Abutin, who canceled his Amazon account after the 
company began collecting sales tax in September. And he questions whether 
Amazon's same-day delivery - not yet available in his region - is even worth 
it. The $8.99 cost of same-day delivery, plus about a $1 per-item fee, doesn't 
add up for him.

 "You're looking at way too much overhead for anything costing less than 
$150," he said.

 Abutin prefers Google Shopping, which he says allows him to compare prices 
across dozens of websites without leaving his computer chair.

 But Amazon has raised the bar on retail delivery and competitors are running 
to catch up. "Everybody is assessing this - whether or not they want to pursue 
it, and whether or not they can," said Bruce Cohen, retailer and consumer 
strategist with Kurt Salmon in San Francisco. "For businesses, it's innovate or 
step aside."

 EBay's delivery service, currently limited to San Francisco and available 
only through a free iTunes app called eBay Now, allows customers to get 
purchases hand-delivered to anywhere they want within an hour. If the customer 
wants to return the item, the driver will schedule a pickup and the refund 
appears in the customer's PayPal account.

 On a call with reporters Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe said 
the app is part of eBay's expansive mobile strategy to partner with local 
retailers and entice more customers to sell and buy from their smartphones. The 
company gained about 800,000 new mobile users in the third quarter.

 Company spokeswoman Shustarovich said eBay Now deliveries have included an 
iPhone charger to a bar and a sweater to a chilly customer in a park.

 She said: "Our goal is to bring the customer the product wherever they happen 
to be."

What to Wear to a Retail Interview 

 What to wear to a retail interview depends on the type of retailer and the 
level position you are applying for. In some cases, you'll need to dress

 Store Meetings for Retailers 

When, Where and Why to Hold a Store Meeting with Staff

 From Shari Waters , 
former About.com Guide



The best way to disseminate important information to retail store employees 
is by holding a store meeting. Some retailers have mandatory monthly meetings 
and others wait until special events or circumstances arise which may warrant a 
store meeting. Another good time to have a store meeting is when you've hired 
new staff and want to restate store policies with all employees.

When to Have a Store Meeting

The ideal time to hold a store meeting will depend on the size of your staff, 
their length of employment and the topic(s) to be discussed. If your shop only 
has one or two employees, a store meeting could be an impromptu 15 minute 
discussion during a lull in shoppers. Meetings with larger groups may take more 
planning to get everyone together.

Scheduling the Meeting

Plan your store's meeting at least one to two weeks in advance. Pick a time 
when most employees will be available. A store meeting would be fine after 
hours or before opening the store.

Post an announcement regarding the meeting in a conspicuous place. A note 
written near the weekly schedule is a good location. Don't forget to mention 
the date/time to each employee a few days before the store meeting.

If your goal is to have a monthly meeting, schedule a recurring time for your 
store meetings. For example, if everyone knows that the store meeting is held 
every first Sunday of the month at 8 AM then you should have a better 
attendance rate.

What Should be Discussed?

Topics for a store meeting should include any recent issues or other general 
problem areas. Otherstore meeting topics 
 
could be:


 * Customer Service 
 * Loss Prevention 
 * Policies & Procedures 
 * Business Goals As you plan the meeting, be sure to keep the tone positive. 
Bring up any good examples you've seen exhibited by the staff. Use the store 
meeting to role play, or physically show the employees how to do something.

People accept and retain information differently. Keep the meeting on topic, 
brief and include a printed outline of the information discussed to give to 
each employee.

Be sure to open the floor for any questions, comments or concerns. Let the 
employees provide feedback and air any grievances they may have. If the meeting 
is turning into a gripe session, ask for solutions to the problems. It could 
lead to a better working environment for everyone involved.

Follow Up

Once the meeting is over, take time to follow up on any concerns or questions 
brought up by the staff. Get the answers to them as soon as possible. This will 
show you are as dedicated to them as you are to running your store.

Information Needs of Organic Growers and Retailers

Abstract: Growth in consumer interest in organically grown foods has opened 
new market opportunities for producers and retailers. This in turn implies an 
increased need for information specific to organic production, processing, 
marketing, and retail as growers and retailers increase their activities in 
this market. This article describes a research effort in east-central Kansas to 
assess the information needs in the organic sector. Data are drawn from focus 
groups and individual interviews with growers and retailers of organic foods. 
Implications for research and Extension programs, especially in the central 
Plains states, are discussed.

Introduction

The production and sale of organic foods in the U.S. continues to expand 
rapidly. Certified organic acreage for major crops and pasture doubled between 
1997 and 2001 (Greene & Dimitri, 2003) and doubled again between 2002 and 2005, 
bringing the total organic acreage in the U.S. to over 4.0 million acres by 
2005 (ERS-USDA, 2007). Although organic foods comprise a small portion of total 
food sales, organic food sales have been growing by 17-21% annually over the 
past decade, with sales reaching $13.8 billion in 2005 (OTA, 2006). Moreover, 
the global market for organic products has been growing rapidly, with global 
organic food and drink sales at about $40 billion in 2006 (Organic Monitor, 
2006). The economic future of organic production appears bright in many areas 
of the world, as analysts continue to anticipate market expansion.

Burgeoning consumer interest in organically grown foods has opened new market 
opportunities for producers and retailers. Of particular interest to retailers 
is the fact that more organic food is now purchased in conventional 
supermarkets than any other venue (Greene & Dimitri, 2003). Not only is there 
continued strong demand for fresh produce, but there is growth in demand for a 
range of organic products, including those based on grains, dairy, and meats. 
This growth provides an opportunity for farmers to innovate and expand 
production of a range of agricultural commodities. As farmers enter these 
markets, their need for information specific to organic production and 
marketing will increase accordingly. Likewise, retailers need specific market 
analysis as they increase their activities in this area.

This article describes a research effort in east-central Kansas to assess the 
information needs for organic production, processing, marketing, and retail in 
the region. Findings are intended to inform the development of research and 
Extension programs to address these needs. Broader implications for research 
and Extension programs, especially in the central Plains states, are discussed.

Methods

Two primary activities were conducted to achieve the research objectives: 
focus groups with growers and face-to-face interviews with retailers. Each of 
these activities is described below.

Focus Groups

Four focus groups were conducted with experienced growers. Three groups 
comprised established organic growers, and the fourth comprised growers 
interested in making the transition from conventional to organic production. 
The groups were formed in an attempt to achieve homogeneity of knowledge and 
experience across participants (Greenbaum, 1998), as there is concern that 
disparity in knowledge levels is likely to discourage those with less knowledge 
of a topic from full participation in the discussion (Krueger & Casey, 2000).

Homogeneity was achieved by identifying growers with approximately similar 
experience related to organic agriculture. Geographic diversity was sought 
among the participants; however, for practical reasons the geographic scope was 
limited to eastern-central Kansas. Also, the scope of the discussion was 
limited within each group by emphasizing participants engaged in producing 
similar commodities. In three of the groups (including the transitional grower 
group) the participants were engaged primarily in the production of grains, 
forage crops, and/or beef. The fourth group emphasized horticultural producers.

Average group size was between seven and eight participants, who were asked 
about the challenges they face and the information they perceive as necessary 
for organic production, processing, and marketing. It was determined that 
saturation was reached at the completion of four focus groups (i.e., a range of 
ideas had been established and no significantly new information was emerging), 
and thus further sessions were deemed unnecessary (Krueger & Casey, 2000).

Interviews

The other key source of data was interviews with retailers of organic foods. 
We sought variation in retailers by size, market orientation, and location. 
Interviews were obtained with large conventional retailers, large retailers 
with an emphasis on organics, and small/medium stores focused on organics. Key 
informants in a variety of leadership positions in the stores were interviewed. 
No attempt was made to obtain a random sample of interviewees; rather, the 
sample was seen as purposive (Altheide, 1996).

Eight in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted in the urban areas 
of Kansas City, Lawrence, Manhattan and Wichita. The intent of the interviews 
was to maximize variation in responses so as to gain as complete a view as 
possible of the informants' understanding of challenges and information needs 
with respect to retailing organic foods (Strauss, 1987). Informants were asked 
about their retail operations, about challenges and opportunities, and about 
information that would be helpful to them as an organic foods retailer.

Analysis

Analysis of the focus group and interview data followed the guidelines laid 
out by Krueger and Casey (2000) for focus group and Strauss (1987) for 
interviews. The basic strategy includes examining transcripts, categorizing 
responses, and analyzing themes that emerge in the data. Quotes that are used 
below are chosen as the best representations of the themes.

Focus Group Results

Challenges

Following an intentionally broad discussion on organic agriculture and 
growers' reasons for becoming organic, the focus groups were guided toward the 
more narrow transition question, which was phrased as follows:

 What do you see as challenges for you as an organic grower? From the 
discussion around this question, a listing of key challenges was recorded. 
After the discussion reached saturation regarding the main points, participants 
were asked to vote to prioritize the most important issues. Priority challenges 
perceived by growers in all the focus groups are summarized below, and can be 
categorized into (1) technical/production, (2) marketing, (3) 
education/awareness, and (4) practical models.

Technical/Production

The majority of challenges perceived by growers as priorities can be 
categorized as technical/production issues. An important component of 
production challenges is a perceived lack of available organic expertise, 
captured by one of the participants' comments, "Who you gonna call?" These and 
other production-related issues are discussed below.

Weed Control

Weed control is a priority challenge. Issues raised included mitigating weed 
problems through cropping systems design, the lack of products to deal with 
weed problems, and challenges associated with mechanical cultivation. 
Interestingly, pest/insect control emerged more in the prospective/transition 
group than in the others. This may be a reflection of more experienced organic 
growers' ability to maintain pest populations in balance, resulting in insect 
pests being perceived as less of a challenge as compared to weeds.

Organic Expertise

The availability of expertise in organic production is another priority 
challenge. Participants agreed that when the need arises for technical 
assistance related to organic production, there are few people to call upon who 
have expertise relevant to their region. Extension, county agents, and local 
cooperatives have been unhelpful because these traditional sources of 
information have little knowledge of organic production, according to the 
participants. While general information about organic production is available 
on the Internet, it is often not specific to the region in terms of climate, 
soils, varieties, pest cycles, markets, and other factors. The following 
comment captures the general sentiment:

When I have a question, I go to the web . . . but the information I find is 
not specific to the region; it is from the west or east coast, but it is often 
not applicable because it is not specific to our pest cycles, our 
regional/local climates and soils. How do we access that information? Another 
participant stated the problem in practical terms: "It would be helpful to have 
someone like"Joe" around who could be called upon for advice."

Ideas that emerged out of the discussions on expertise include: (1) a 
qualified organic Extension specialist who could "float" in the state, and (2) 
a centralized database to provide regionally specific information and technical 
assistance on organic production.

Time Management, Labor

Another category in production that received priority votes was time 
management and labor. The key issue is that organic production is labor 
intensive, and meeting the labor needs of an organic operation is challenging. 
Furthermore, growers expressed difficulty in paying reasonable wages, 
especially in small-scale operations.

Marketing

The two key challenges that growers articulated regarding marketing were 
organic certification and the ability of small growers to identify and enter 
organic markets.

Certification

The groups saw the organic certification process as bureaucratic and 
cumbersome, particularly for horticultural products as compared to grains. The 
documentation requirements associated with certification were perceived as 
heavy and thus as a potential barrier to entering organic production or 
maintaining certification. Other issues raised in relation to certification 
were fees and organic standards.

Small Growers and Marketing

The second challenge, in broad terms, has to do with the structure of 
agriculture, and the challenges faced by small-scale organic growers in that 
structure. Smaller organic growers face barriers related to a lack of marketing 
power in the context of a consolidating organic foods industry. Also, in many 
cases marketing and distribution networks are not as established as they are 
for conventional growers and federal programs are scarcer--all of which combine 
to make profitably venturing into organic agriculture challenging.

Education and Awareness

The key challenge that growers raised regarding education was the perceived 
lack of knowledge on the part of the public about the environmental, social, 
and health benefits of organic foods. That much of the mainstream public does 
not fully understand the unique benefits of organic agriculture, as compared to 
conventional, results in a lack of policy support, according to participants.

Practical Models

The final category of challenges has to do with practical information and 
models. The central question was how to partner more with the land-grant 
university in order to generate practical, applicable information helpful to 
organic farmers. The main issue seemed to be that the participants were 
searching for a way to engage with the local land-grant university in order to 
generate relevant information and perhaps develop a model for established and 
prospective organic farmers to follow (e.g., on-farm research, research 
partnerships, demonstration farms).

Information Needs

The transition question was followed by more narrow key questions, which were 
divided into three areas, phrased as follows:

If we think of the growing cycle as involving inputs, production, processing, 
and marketing, what kinds of information on (1) Inputs/production, (2) 
Processing, (3) Marketing . . . would be most helpful to you? From the 
discussion around these questions a list of key information needs was recorded. 
Because the previous question had already allowed participants to discuss 
challenges, the discussion on information needs was relatively focused. The 
lists generated are summarized below.

Information Needs for Inputs/Production

agriculture Retailer Interview Results

Retailers were varied by size, market orientation, and geography. In terms of 
size, the two categories are large and small/medium. Of the eight interviews, 
five can be considered large retailers, and three are small/medium. The two 
categories used to distinguish market orientation are "conventional" and 
"core-organic." Core-organic refers to retailers whose mission includes organic 
foods. Not all of the large stores are conventional (two are core-organic). In 
contrast, all of the small/medium stores interviewed can be considered 
core-organic.

Challenges

The challenges identified by retailers can be categorized into three main 
themes: (a) public perceptions and understanding of organic, (b) limited 
distribution networks, and (c) in-store challenges.

Public Perception

Core-organic retailers in particular noted a public perception, whether 
accurate or not, that organic foods are not affordable, especially for those on 
limited incomes. Some retailers offered arguments against this perception, yet 
conceded that "price keeps some away." Further, these retailers generally held 
the view that the public still lacks a full understanding of the environmental 
and health problems associated with the conventional food system and therefore 
does not understand the differences between conventional and organic. A final 
concern is that in a consolidating organic foods industry the meaning of 
"organic" will become diluted as large corporations use their influence to 
weaken organic standards.

Limited Distribution Networks

Distribution networks for organic produce are more limited in the Midwest 
relative to the coasts, occasionally causing availability and pricing 
challenges, according to retailers. For those who procure some organic foods 
locally, local wholesale and distribution networks are also prone to shortages 
and other disruptions.

In-Store Challenges

Conventional retailers noted a number of challenges related to the 
characteristics of organic produce, including consistency, appearance, shelf 
life, and differences in stocking and display requirements.

Information Needs

Information on Consumers and Markets

There was generally agreement on this need. The conventional stores in 
particular were interested in studies of consumer demographics. Who is buying 
organics, who is not, and what are their characteristics by age, gender, income 
level, educational level, and residential zip code? Both conventional and 
core-organic stores were interested in the motivational reasons behind 
purchasing patterns, questions such as: What attracts consumers? What convinces 
them to make the initial organic purchase, and to continue purchasing organics? 
Why do consumers convert to organic foods? What premiums will the market bear? 
How do we retain customers?

Public Education About Organics

Core-organic retailers in particular felt that the public's knowledge of 
organics is often lacking, uneven, or misinformed. They articulated a need to 
define "organic" for the public and to educate the public about organic 
agriculture. Specific needs expressed include information bulletins on organic 
production and foods, especially their benefits, and comparisons of 
conventional and organic foods and production. As one informant phrased it,

 People want to know if it's more nutritious. That's what I hear. They want a 
comparison when we're out giving talks. They want to know if an organic apple 
is more nutritious than a conventional apple. That's one I hear a lot. . . . 
And not just vitamins and minerals, but some of the vital [natural substances] 
that people are really interested in for cancer prevention. In an interview 
with a core-organic retailer, it was suggested that to achieve the public 
education and outreach, Extension expertise in organic agriculture is needed: 
"I'd like to see Extension offices embrace organics because we interface with 
Extension . . . we need [their] buy in."

Limited Availability of Kansas Organic Products

A third theme was the limited availability of organic products from Kansas, 
especially packaged products, such as grain-based snacks, soymilk, and meats. 
Retailers noted that while packaged organic has been a rapid growth area--and 
accounts for a significant portion of sales--there are very few packaged 
organic products from Kansas available to retailers. One retailer noted,

 We would like to do more. I only know of one company in Kansas who is making 
packaged organic products . . . . If we had packaged organic goods from Kansas, 
that would be a competitive edge because we would have two strong reasons to 
buy the product: it would be local and organic.  It was also noted that 
producers and wholesalers of organic foods may need help linking up with 
local/regional sources of organic products, properly packaging their products 
so that retailers can use them, and increasing awareness among retailers of 
product availability. On this last point, the concern is that even if a Kansas 
producer/wholesaler has a product, if it is not available through one of the 
large distributors, retailers may not be aware of it.

Implications for Research and Extension

The study reported here shows a need for research and Extension efforts in 
the organic agriculture and food sector that span the agrifood chain, from 
inputs through production, processing, manufacturing, distribution, retail and 
consumer patterns. These needs are being driven by growing demand globally for 
organic foods. The findings herein are based on a research project in 
east-central Kansas, but arguably apply more broadly.

One of the themes that emerged in the focus groups was the lack of 
information on organic production that is specific to local/regional climates, 
soils, and other conditions. We thought this might be particularly true for 
central Plains states, and polled the state SARE State Sustainable Agriculture 
Coordinators in the corridor of states from North Dakota to Texas (North/South 
Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas). We asked them about their 
state's specialists and programs dedicated to organic production.

In short, there appears to be a dearth of programs dedicated to organic 
agriculture in this corridor of states, which corroborates the growers' sense 
in this study of the lack of regionally specific information. In the six 
states, none has a full-time faculty level Extension specialist dedicated to 
organic agriculture, though there are specialists in each state who devote 
partial time to organic work. Further, none of the states has a dedicated 
research program for organic production, though again there are partial 
appointments in at least three of the states that involve organic research. The 
University of Nebraska recently received a sizable grant for organic research 
over five years.

In terms of curriculum, none of the six states has a degree program or 
certificate program in organic agriculture. Two of the states have specific 
coursework in organic cropping systems. This seems to be in contrast to other 
regions of the country, where programs of study in organic agriculture have 
been instituted (e.g., Washington, Colorado, and Michigan state universities).

Moreover, the lack of dedicated organic programs in this corridor of states 
stands out when juxtaposed with the apparent opportunities for organic 
production of commodities in which these states have distinctive strengths. In 
particular, these are important states for beef, wheat, sorghum, soybeans, and 
irrigated corn and cotton. Also, the bulk of some lesser crops are produced 
primarily in this region, such as sunflower, oats, and barley. Thus, there are 
significant opportunities for conversion to organic production as well as 
opportunities in a variety of specialty products (e.g., organic flour, oatmeal, 
cereals, etc.).

The study reported here was designed to identify challenges and assess the 
information needs for organic production, processing, marketing, and retail, as 
perceived by growers and retailers. The perceptions and opinions of Extension 
professionals on these issues were not addressed in this study. Of course, many 
in Extension are well aware of current trends in the organic sector, are 
knowledgeable about the issues raised in this article, and have been grappling 
with how to respond programmatically to meet future needs in this area.

It would be a worthy research effort to also study the perceptions of 
Extension professionals on these issues. The comparison of those results with 
the present study would be a useful beginning to identify differences in 
understanding, problems in communication, and potentially a productive way 
forward.

Clearly, the study raises politically charged questions that are beyond the 
scope of this article. It also suggests a need and an opportunity for Extension 
and the organic grower/retailer community to engage in an open dialogue in 
order to compare and challenge each other's perceptions on these issues and 
work collaboratively to develop an effective programmatic approach to 
addressing this dynamic sector.

 Q: What's the difference between 32- and 64-bit versions of Windows?

A: 32- and 64-bits refer to the way a computer’s central processor 
(essentially, its brain) handles information. Computers that contain 64-bit 
processors handle data in larger blocks, which makes them more efficient. You 
can’t put software designed for a 64-bit system on a 32-bit system, though — it 
won’t work.

To find out what type of system your computer is running:


 * Click Start, right-click Computer, and then click Properties
 * The operating system appears as follows:
 * For a 64-bit version operating system, "64-bit Operating System" appears 
under System Type.
 * For a 32-bit version operating system, "32-bit Operating System" appears 
for under System Type. 

 Q: How do I get status of my order?

A: Please go to Tracking Your Order

A retail manager is the administrator of the department assigned, and has many 
responsibilities as compared to the other retail stores’ employees.

Questions that are asked in an interview for retail managerial positions 
designed to evaluate several competencies of the candidates such as, 
professional qualifications, personality, organizational capabilities, team 
managements and communication skills.

The article presents some of these questions with tips on responding to these 
questions.

Retail Manager
 Job Interview Questions and Answers

? Tell us a bit about your professional background and educational 
qualification.
 Speak about your professional background. If you have experience in retail 
sales, provide dates and other details such as product range, number of 
customers per day or hour, size of outlet, etc. If you lack experience in this 
specific field, try to relate any experience you do have, even if volunteer, to 
the retail manager position. Find commonalities; relate some anecdotes that 
will show you can perform as a retail manager. Consult with friends involved in 
retail establishments for assistance if need be.

? What do you feel is the key role of a retail manager?
 This question is asked to determine whether you have an understanding of what 
a retail manager’s position is. Use this opportunity to speak about the retail 
management business and what you think would be your responsibilities would 
be.  Read up about the position! Once the interviewer is convinced that you 
understand the role of a retail manager, your chances of being hired are good.

Some duties and qualities required of the retail manager are:


 * Team leadership and team development abilities. 
 * Managing the hiring process: HR activities and employee training. 
 * Workplace scheduling – Day to day operations. 
 * Problem solving skills – Communications skills. 
 * Sales management. 
 * Product and project management – Professional qualities and prioritization. 
? If you have worked as a retail manager before, what did you like the most in 
your job and what did you not like?
 It is always good to start and end on a positive note. Make a list of the 
pros and cons of your previous job(s). Pick a few facets and add some specific 
examples. Speak about the most important first, and end with an upbeat 
anecdote. In the middle, speak briefly about a negative aspect. Speak with 
others in this field to get a better idea of what to emphasize.

? What do you feel are the basic qualities that a retail manager should have?
 A general yet brief answer would be vision, planning and follow through. An 
idea is just that until it is actualized. A manager needs to do just that – 
manage others, according to a planned and thought out strategy.
 A retail manager is similar to the proprietor of a store and has many 
responsibilities as compared to the other employees. If a retail manager is 
good at planning and has a vision for the future, he or she can take the 
company to the next level.

? What would you consider your biggest advantage as a retail manager?
 Use your personal experience and speak to people in the field – enter any 
store and ask the manager this question. You will probably pick up some very 
relevant points. Consult with a friend if need be to see which of your 
qualities make you most suited for this position.
 Possible answers could be – Leadership ability, sales manager or good

 Spring 2007 
Are you a great store manager? by Phillip M. Perry 
 

 Hello there! If you are new here, you 
might want tosubscribe to the RSS feed  
for updates on this topic.At the most basic level, every successful retailer 
must know how to display merchandise, schedule staff and take inventory. But 
those basic retail skills are only part of the picture when it comes to owning 
or managing a store.

“Champion” store managers also possess an array of personal attributes that 
transform employees into top performers. “Great store managers first and 
foremost have people skills,” notes Shep Hyken, a St. Louis-based retail 
consultant. “Managing on the store level means meeting and motivating the 
retail staff.”

So how good are you at managing those who work for you? Test yourself with 
this quiz. Rate yourself from one to 10 (the highest level) on each of these 10 
questions. Then calculate your score, the closer to 100 the better you’re doing.


1. Do you challenge employees to set new performance goals?

 No matter how you judge performance—sales, productivity, or efficiency—you 
must inspire employees to do better. “The great store manager encourages 
employees to set high goals,” says Fred Martels, president of People Solution 
Strategies, Chesterfield, MO. Each employee should continually establish 
specific, achievable goals and draw up an action plan for meeting them.

Tip: Ask employees what they need from you in order to meet their goals, and 
follow up with encouragement.


2. Do you coach employees to overcome performance issues? 

 Motivated workers are great, but even the most enthusiastic sometimes 
encounter performance problems. That’s when the great store manager starts 
coaching. “Coaching encourages employees to generate creative solutions to 
performance problems,” Hyken says. Because coaching emphasizes collaboration 
rather than confrontation, these efforts improve workplace effectiveness while 
avoiding the costly stress generated by disciplinary sessions.

Tip: When coaching, stay focused on identifying solutions to problems and 
giving employees the tools they need to implement those solutions.


3. Do you encourage employees to contribute new ideas?

 Employees who contribute ideas feel invested in your store’s success. “The 
manager must encourage employees to speak up and then listen to what they have 
to say,” says Martels.

The best store managers include employees in decision-making by encouraging 
them to suggest ways to do things better, says Martels. “Rather than be your 
store’s problem solver, encourage a team effort. Ask stimulating questions such 
as: ‘Here is our problem. How do we solve it?’”

Tip: Rather than dismissing ideas that have been tried before, ask how the 
idea can be modified in the face of experience.


4. Do you take a personal interest in your employees?

 Employees aren’t just cogs in your profit machine. When managers recognize 
their employees have a life outside of work, and help employees balance life 
and work, motivation can skyrocket. “Little things mean a lot to employees,” 
says Leil Lowndes, a New York City-based author of books on communications 
skills. “Learn their kids’ names. Remember their birthdays. Say ‘Hello’ in the 
hallways.”

Tip: Get to know your employees’ outside interests, she adds. “Asking about 
their hobbies and vacations will help you make better work assignments.” Taking 
a personal interest in people’s lives encourages them to stay with the store 
and commit to its goals.


5. Do you delegate well?

 “Great store managers let go and delegate,” says Hyken. “Too many times I’ve 
seen people without that ability attempt to micromanage every process in their 
stores. Then they get stressed out because they are trying to do everything 
themselves.” The result is employees who have little responsibility and feel 
disengaged and demoralized. That will lead to a bad attitude, which will impact 
your bottom line.

The courage to delegate doesn’t come easily. Hyken suggests using this 
formula: First visualize the result you want the employee to achieve. Then list 
the steps required to achieve that result and the skills requisite to each 
step. Then rate the employee’s skills in those areas on a scale of one to five, 
five meaning that the employee has all the requisite skills to accomplish the 
job. Does the employee have the necessary skills to get the job done, or is 
there a better candidate within the organization?

Tip: Just because an employee doesn’t have the skills to complete a difficult 
project, doesn’t mean they can’t be trained. Take a look at your skills ratings 
to determine what skills you need to train for—and start today.


6. Do you communicate your priorities and directions clearly? 

 You know what you want from your employees. But do they? 

Employees can’t perform well when they don’t know what constitutes success. 
“Usually employees don’t really know what’s critically important to their 
managers,” says Lowndes. And if there’s been a recent change in management, 
things can get sticky. “Employees usually assume their current managers share 
the values of previous [managers]. That might not be the case.”

Great store managers communicate what’s important in clear language. Is it 
accuracy of work? Arriving on time? Being gracious with customers? Whatever 
your top priorities, communicate them.

Tip: When an employee has not met your standards, couch your correction in 
words that inspire as well as challenge. Focus more on what needs to be done 
differently—and exactly how—more than on what went wrong.


7. Do you resolve conflicts in a productive way?

 Effective store managers turn “bad” conflicts into “good” results. “Conflict 
can be bad when people just scream at each other,” says Hyken. “But it can be 
good when it leads to new solutions for old problems.” When two employees are 
in conflict, Hyken says, be sure to counsel each separately. You might start 
with a statement such as this: “I see this happening in the work place…. Tell 
me what you are seeing.” Follow up with a statement designed to assess how the 
conflict affects the employee: “I feel [this way] about what is happening…. 
Tell me what you are feeling.”

Emphasize the consequence of not resolving the conflict in terms of decreased 
productivity or even job termination.

Tip: Be a great negotiator: Find out what the parties to the conflict want, 
and help them achieve it.


8. Do you behave in a professional manner at work? 

 Do you act like a professional? Are you a role model for your employees? 
“Personal characteristics and attitudes are important and often-overlooked 
elements in a competency model,” says Florence M. Stone, a New York City-based 
author of management books. “We are talking about your ability to be a role 
model.”

Stone gives these examples of basic professional behavior: 


 * Dedication to work and willingness to put in long hours 
 * Giving credit to employees rather than to oneself 
 * Avoiding rumors and excessive socializing at work 
 * Communicating in a thoughtful way 
 * Arriving at work and meetings on time  If you’re not setting a good example 
for your employees in these areas, negative behaviors are likely to trickle 
down throughout the organization.

Tip: Ask your employees to assess themselves on their workplace behaviors. 
Meet with employees to iron-out any big differences between how you would score 
them and how they scored themselves.


9. Do you inspire your employees? 

 Are you cheerful? Do you project enthusiasm? In other words, do you have a 
dynamic personality that inspires others?

“A great store manager must be able to inspire and enable employees to 
perform at their best,” says Ian Jacobsen, a Morgan Hill, CA-based management 
consultant.

Enthusiasm begins with a genuine interest in the business, plus an interest 
in the other people who work in that business, which often manifests as simple 
friendliness. Great store managers never miss a chance to be friendly in 
behavior and speech. Greet everyone with a “Good morning!” “Employees will 
almost always set their whole day by how their managers treat them in the 
morning,” says Jacobsen.

Tip: Communicate your vision for the business clearly, and let your employees 
know that you consider each of them key to your success.


10. Do you listen well?

 “Great store managers are clear communicators,” affirms Mel Kleiman, a 
Houston-based management consultant. “And communications is a two-way street: 
We’re talking not only about speaking and writing but also listening.”

Here are some tips from Kleiman on being a good listener: 


 * Encourage the employee to open up 
 * Summarize and repeat what you hear. This gives the employee an opportunity 
to correct misapprehension.
 * Ask the employee to express feelings about the issue 
 * Keep your focus on the employee. Don’t start telling your own stories. 
 * Encourage the employee to generate solutions to problems. Don’t give advice.
Tip: Maintain good eye contact when in conversation.

 With Friends!    The 5 Toughest Problems Facing Online Retailers

What are the toughest problems facing online retailers in 2003?

Problem # 1 Getting visitors

The number one complaint of online retailers is they are not getting enough 
visitors.

Many choose to get visitors the same way their competitors do. Online 
retailers try search engine placement, pay-per-clicks, banner ads and other 
marketing tactics.

Banners can cost as little as $1 per 1000 views. Email lists can be as 
inexpensive as $30 per 10,000 names. Despite these low prices, retailers are 
finding that many times these tactics don’t deliver enough sales to justify the 
cost.

Problem # 2 Low conversion rates

Turning visitors into customers is the second biggest problem that online 
retailers face. This becomes a greater problem when retailers sell items that 
people prefer to see and touch before buying, such as clothing.

Do you know the answers to this question:

What percentage of your visitors become your customers?

That percentage is your sales conversion rate. This number is one of the most 
overlooked and most impactful numbers in online marketing. It’s overlooked 
because website owners often think that more visitors is the route to more 
customers. What if their marketing is bringing lots of visitors but their 
website is sending them away?

Websites can send visitors away in many ways, from frustratingly slow 
download times to poor sales copy. Visitors in general complain of having to 
download plug-ins to view the website and confusing navigation.

Most ecommerce businesses are getting 1-2% sales conversion. A small change 
in your conversion rate can have a big impact on your bottom line.

Let’s say you run your numbers and find that you have a 1% conversion rate. 
Applying marketing know-how, you make some changes to your website that makes 
customers more likely to buy. Next week you test your sales conversion rate and 
find that it’s 2%. You’ve doubled your sales, without spending more money 
marketing!

Once you get your sales conversion higher, your marketing budget performs 
better. The same money that was bringing you 1% sales conversion is now 
bringing 2% sales conversion.

While a small change in your sales conversion rate will have a great impact 
on revenues, most website owners are unaware of this and are losing sales.

 Problem # 3 The proximity of the competition

According to Nielsen/Netratings, February 2003, the average visitor spends 
only 55 seconds per webpage. In less than a minute, your visitors decide 
whether to continue viewing your pages or click away.

How many of your competitors are online? Find out now by going to your 
favorite search engine and typing in keywords prospective customers would use 
when looking for your business. How many options do your potential customers 
have?

Even if a visitor wants what you offer, he is tempted to comparison shop. 
It’s very easy to click and go to another site. Are you doing everything you 
can to get customers to buy from you?

Problem # 4 Price-shopping

If you sell something exclusive, price-shopping wouldn’t be a problem for you 
until competition shows up on the scene.

However, if you sell products that other websites offer, then you’ll find 
intense pressure to lower your prices. Search engines give prospective 
customers a list of options. Plus, there are price comparison websites like 
Pricegrabber, MySimon and Dealtime that make it easy for consumers to 
price-shop. They give their users prices from several websites.

Problem # 5 Shopping cart abandonment

A visitor decides to buy from you. Somewhere between placing items in the 
shopping cart and completing the purchase they leave your website, usually for 
good.

More than 60 percent of online shoppers abandon purchases before completing 
the credit card transaction, according to Gartner Group, Inc. Which means if 40 
people buy from you, 100 started to buy from you. Imagine how many more sales 
you’d have if you prevented some of these abandoned carts.

Identifying the toughest problems facing online retailers is the first step 
in dealing effectively with them.

3 pressing issues facing retailers and marketers using mobile

 By Chantal Tode  
June 7, 2011

 
Marketers are looking for the best ways to reach consumers via mobile

There is no doubt that mobile is growing, but the industry faces several 
pressing questions if it wants to continue moving along the same path.   

Mobile applications and the mobile Web have grown quickly in the past couple 
of years to the point where well-known national brands are regular players in 
the space. However, mobile is still fragmented and marketers need to be 
thinking two or three steps ahead if they want to meet consumers’ needs easily 
and efficiently.

“Mobile advertising – whether through mobile bar codes, on the mobile 
Internet or via applications – is now no longer a trial medium for marketers,” 
said Laura Marriott, chief executive officer atNeoMedia Technologies 

, Atlanta, GA. “Mobile has the ability to breathe new life into traditional and 
digital campaigns, enabling engagement with the consumer on impulse.”

But because mobile is such a personal communications channel, there are 
specific issues unique to mobile marketers must address while still keeping 
their eye on the overall marketing strategy, per Ms. Marriott.

 




Here is what industry experts have to say about the top issues facing mobile 
marketers. 

How to best engage customers using tailored communications
While there is a lot of talk about location-based targeting via, marketers 
should be careful to match consumer need and behavior with their campaign 
strategy, considering all possible ways to tailor communications to provide 
value.

“Access to relevant content, discount coupons, or exclusive information can 
help grab consumer attention and encourage interaction,” Ms. Marriott said.

“This tried-and-true marketing strategy is a great way to increase a user 
base and will promote user participation in the campaign, so be sure that any 
communication is tailored to the target consumer using the data available to 
you and offers value in a form suitable for both brand and campaign,” she said.

Right now, marketers are looking for ways to engage in cross-channel 
targeting across every mobile channel they are in. This is not easy because 
mobile is not a cookie-based environment and there is no standardization across 
mobile ad units.

However, the payoff could be significant.

“This year we’ve seen a lot of interest in using the same targeting metrics 
from online in mobile,” said Zaw Thet, CEO of4Info 

, San Mateo, CA.

“As this happens, there will be an exponential growth in mobile as marketers 
start to move their online budgets into mobile”, he said.

Geotargeting, in particular, deserves attention.

With all the attention being paid to mobile’s consumer privacy issues in 
Washington and by consumer advocates, many are watching to see what the impact 
will be on the use of location in mobile advertising.

A big focus for mobile marketers is on using mobile to send consumers a 
targeted mobile offer when their phone shows they are in close proximity to an 
advertiser.

“That is the Holy Grail of what location is capable of but, the question is 
will consumers be comfortable with that and do retailers need that level of 
granularity,” said Brett Leary, vice president and director of the mobile 
practice atDigitas 

, Boston.

“There is a big difference in the implications for privacy between targeting 
at the ZIP code level versus targeting three feet away and that needs to get 
sorted out,” he said.

Looking further ahead, however, marketers may want to consider whether it 
makes more sense to have apps across multiple devices or a single mobile Web 
presence.

As the number of platforms has grown, marketers are having to update apps and 
push this out to all these different platforms, which can be time consuming and 
expensive.

“Marketers want to want to be able to reach as wide a targeted audience as 
possible,” said Neil Strother, practice director of mobile marketing strategies 
and mobile services atABI Research 

, Kirkland, WA. “The mobile Web is that standardized platform.”

What role should mobile play in a brand’s overall marketing strategy?
Marketers need to plan ahead and integrate mobile into the marketing mix if 
they want to get the most out of it.

“This will help insure that interactivity is a key element of the campaign 
itself and not simply added as an afterthought,” NeoMedia’s Ms. Marriott said. 
“Continued consumer engagement should be a key benchmark in determining the 
overall success of your campaign, so planning for it early on will only serve 
to bolster consumer satisfaction with your campaign.”

This means marketers should align their mobile efforts with the customer 
journey and not have a separate strategy for mobile.

“If you treat mobile in a siloed way, you are not able to find those insights 
that enable us to create greater relevancy with apps and mobile ads,” Digitas’ 
Mr. Leary said.

Metrics to use to measure the success of a mobile campaign
This needs to address the fragmentation that currently exists in mobile 
advertising.

“There is a lot of fragmentation with iAd, other display ad formats and newer 
emerging formats such as rich media,” Mr. Leary said. “All of these need to be 
smoothed into an efficient system in order  for marketers to spend more in 
mobile.”

How the industry standardizes measurement is something a lot of players in 
the industry have their eyes on.

“Because mobile has the ability to connect the digital and physical worlds, 
the question can we find the way to close the loop between these two worlds 
when it comes to marketing,” Mr. Leary said.

This represents an important opportunity to differentiate mobile because if 
the industry can figure out a way to tie back an in-store purchase to a mobile 
marketing message the purchaser received. Companies such as Nielsen and 4Info 
and trying to make this happen.

Being able to provide a clear picture of mobile’s return on investment could 
have big ramifications.

“It is going to encourage repeat action, spread overall usage of the medium 
and investment in it by advertisers,” Mr. Leary said.

First of all, however, the industry needs to address the fragmentation in 
mobile ad units.

“Unlike online, there is not really an easy way to get cross-channel 
accountability in mobile,” 4Info’s Mr. Thet said.

What needs to happen is for marketers to be able to buy mobile ad units from 
one source and to easily view metrics in one report for all of their mobile 
activity, per Mr. Thet.

“We are starting to see more of this with more ad networks starting to 
support third-party tracking,” Mr. Thet said.

Challenges in the Retail Sector

Customer service drives HR activities and decisions.

Digital Vision./Digital Vision/Getty Images

Human Resources manages a retailer's largest controllable expense and 
oversees its most critical success factor: its workforce. With the industry's 
renewed emphasis on customer service, HR professionals play a critical role in 
a retailer's ability to compete. In an atmosphere where just 2.3 negative 
shopping experiences will send a customer elsewhere forever, HR's 
responsibility has added significance. It must adapt training, workforce 
management, recruitment and retention practices to a sustain customer-pleasing, 
loyalty-instilling team.

Training

Online competition has raised the customer service bar for stores as 
consumers research purchases, comparison shop and seek convenience. HR must 
nurture an organizational culture that embraces a positive shopping experience 
for each customer. Training must address an employee's role in the store's 
relationship with its customers. The trend of empowering associates to handle 
issues on the sales floor, rather than seek manager approval, requires a change 
in employee mindset. Skills such as promptly greeting, acknowledging and 
thanking customers must be revisited. Management sets the example, but HR 
training builds the foundation. Product knowledge also has become a component 
of the customer-service equation, necessitating feature-benefit instruction 
that enables those in contact with customers to answer questions and offer 
suggestions.

Workforce Management

Staffing the sales floor traditionally has been a balancing act for retail 
HR. The long business hours, frequent promotional events and seasonal nature of 
the industry put staffing pressure on stores to meet customer service 
expectations yet respect payroll budgets. HR's scheduling expertise must align 
associate attributes to tasks, as well as to shopper profiles, according to a 
2010 "Retail Information Systems News," study. For instance, ensure that 
intimate apparel sales include associates who are certified bra fitters. An 
added challenge, notes Massachusetts-based research firm Aberdeen Group, is 
sales trends that grow less predictable as consumers change their buying habits.

Recruitment

RIS News cites Cavallino Capital's research in which 60 percent of consumers 
surveyed named hiring helpful staff as key for retailers to earn their loyalty. 
Retail HR managers struggle to attract customer-oriented candidates who are 
comfortable with technology and willing to accept irregular hours, holiday 
assignments and relatively low pay. A bad hire can damage the organization's 
reputation and waste resources. Retail HR also faces demographic challenges as 
competition increases the need to present an ethnically diverse workforce with 
whom customers can identify.

Retention

According to the Hay Group, U.S. retail turnover reached a median rate of 67 
percent in the first quarter of 2012. The continuous cycle of hiring, training 
and replacing associates, coupled with exposure to lost sales and sub-par 
customer service from inexperience, consumes HR attention. Although 
attributable mainly to part-time employee departures, turnover hinders a 
store’s ability to grow talent and recruit management from within. The 
challenge for HR centers around teaming with managers to engage employees while 
championing them as critical links to customer loyalty objectives. Frank 
discussions about expectations on both sides result in a better fit; however, 
that may increase the time needed to fill vacancies.

asked questions about retail software, point of sale hardware, and retail 
inventory management systems.

 If you have additional questions, you can ask the retail expert 
.

Choosing the Right Retail POS System


 * Should I choose a retail software package that was designed specifically 
for my industry? 
 
 * How much does a retail POS system cost? 
 
 * There are so many different retail POS systems out there. How will I know 
how to choose the right one? 
 
 * Should I buy the point of sale hardware or the retail software first? 
 
 * How will a retail POS system help me make more money? 

 * How can a retail POS system help me run my business more efficiently? 

 * I have a lot of volunteers and elderly that work at my store. Isn’t it too 
complicated to teach them how to work a computerized retail POS system? 
 
 * Is there a major convention for retail software providers? I want a live 
demo of a point of sale system. 
 Upgrading 
from Electronic Cash Registers to a Retail POS System


 * I already have an electronic cash register, why should I spend the money 
for a retail POS system? 
 * Is my store too small to benefit from a retail POS system? 
 
Features of Retail POS Systems


 * I've seen retail software with hundreds of reporting options. Why do I need 
so many reports? 
 
 * What type of database should I choose? 
 
 * Why is scalability important in a retail POS system? 
 
 * What is PCI DSS and why is it so important? 
 
 * How important are backups? 
 
 * If my server goes down, can the clerks continue ringing up sales?  
 
 * Do I need a software subscription service? 
 
Ecommerce Systems


 * I want a web store. Should I use a separate system for my ecommerce store? 
 Working with 
Technology Vendors


 * How do I choose a vendor? 
 
 * Should I buy or lease a retail POS system? 
  
Should I choose a retail software 
package that was designed specifically for my industry? 

Answer: Not necessarily. While there are many industry-specific software 
packages available, many of them don't offer all of the features available in a 
general retail software package. Often times, a general retail software package 
can do everything that industry-specific software can do, plus a whole lot 
more. Ask yourself what features you need now and in the future. Do you want a 
customer loyalty program? Do you need faster credit card authorizations over

?

Make sure that you don't lock yourself into industry-specific retail software 
that can't handle all of your needs.

 How much does a retail POS system 
cost? 

Answer: Like buying a car, it just depends on what you want. What features do 
you need? How fast do you want it to go? Should you purchase an extended 
warranty? The more features you want, the more your retail POS system will 
cost. A single-user software license can cost between $1,200 and $2,500. Do you 
need new POS terminals? Add $3,000 to $4,000 per workstation. What about new 
scanners, cash drawers, and printers? Add another $900 for each workstation. 
Extended warranties can add $200 per year, but are worth it if your workstation 
ever goes down. A top-of-the-line extended warranty will cost even more, but 
may be worth it if it's one that offers same-day delivery for a brand new, 
fully-configured workstation.

Before you buy any retail point of sale system, do the research. Choosing the 
wrong retail POS system can cost you thousands.

 There are so many different retail 
POS systems out there. How will I know how to choose the right one? 

Answer: First and foremost, take the time to understand the specific needs of 
your store. Establish your total technology budget. If necessary, break it down 
into the things you need this year and things that can wait until next year. 
Find reputable technology companies with years of expertise in the retail 
industry. Ask for references and call them. Many customers are happy to talk 
about their business challenges.

Consider all factors, such as retail software, technical support, service 
after the sale, point of sale hardware, and integration with accounting 
packages or other business software you use. Learn more about how tochoose the 
right retail POS system 
 for your 
business.



 Should I buy the point of sale 
hardware or the retail software first? 

Answer: The single biggest mistake retailers make when choosing a new retail 
POS system is buying the point of sale hardware before the retail software. The 
retail software you choose to run your retail business may not be compatible 
with your new point of sale hardware. Not all scanners, weight scales, or card 
readers will work with all retail software packages. Buying both the point of 
sale hardware and the retail software from the same vendor can reduce or 
eliminate compatibility issues and can often reduce your overall technology 
costs.

Check out the retail POS hardware basics 
 for more 
information on point of sale hardware.

 How will a retail POS system help 
me make more money? 

Answer: A retail POS system can help you increase your profits in many ways. 
Quicker, more reliable checkouts mean less manpower is needed. Sales reports 
allow you to maximize you inventory levels and control costs. Built-in loyalty 
programs encourage higher ticket averages and repeat business from your 
customers. Integrated ecommerce services generate additional revenue from 
Internet sales.

Talk to your technology consultant about other ways a retail POS system can 
help increase your bottom line.

 How can a retail POS system help 
me run my business more efficiently? 

Answer: A good retail POS system increases your efficiency by eliminating 
unnecessary work. Instead of using separate systems for your retail, mail 
order, ecommerce, and wholesale divisions, choose one retail software package 
that can manage your entire business. Choose a retail POS system that increases 
your speed of service with faster ticket entry, on-the-fly data entry, and 
data-driven lookups.

Make sure that the retail software you choose can automate all of your 
process-oriented tasks, such as physical count, purchasing, label printing, and 
customer loyalty.

 I have a lot of volunteers and 
elderly that work at my store. Isn't it too complicated to teach them how to 
work a computerized retail POS system? 

Answer: Learning the basics of a retail POS system is just as easy as 
learning to use a cash register, and if someone makes a mistake, it's much 
easier to correct that mistake on a point of sale system—plus you'll have a 
detailed transaction record of the mistake.

Many of today's user-friendly retail POS systems feature touchscreen 
technology. Your cashiers can use their fingertips or a mouse to touch the 
large, color-coded buttons to process sales. Any concerns you have about 
training seasonal employees or volunteers will be relieved when you see how 
easy touchscreen interface is.

 Is there a major convention for 
retail software providers? I want a live demo of a point of sale system. 

Answer:  There are thousands of retail industry trade shows across the 
country every year. There are trade shows for general retail as well as for 
specific retail industries.Find retail trade shows in your area 
 that plan to have at 
least one technology vendor demonstrating retail software and/or point of sale 
hardware.

 Additionally, most technology vendors will be happy to give you a free demo 
of their retail point of sale system at your request.

 I already have an electronic cash 
register, why should I spend the money for a retail POS system? 

Answer: While an electronic cash register is a suitable way to track money, 
installing a retail POS system will simplify your life as well as your 
customers'. With a retail point of sale system, you'll streamline operations, 
increase checkout times, make more money, increase efficiency, keep better 
inventory records, and have the most robust reporting capabilities right at 
your fingertips. The right retail point of sale system will pay for itself over 
and over again with its functionality.

 Is my store too small to benefit 
from a retail POS system? 

Answer: More than likely, you can't afford not to have a retail point of sale 
system. Today's retail POS systems come in all sizes and are designed to fit 
businesses of any size—from single location mom-and-pop shops to the 
mega-chains with thousands of locations. Do your research, distinguish your 
wants from your needs, and talk to some technology vendors. You'll find that 
there is a retail POS system out there that meets your needs—and your budget.

 I've seen retail software with 
hundreds of reporting options. Why do I need so many reports? 

Answer: The extensive reporting capabilities built into better retail 
software packages offer business owners and managers an in-depth look at their 
businesses. With a few clicks of a mouse, you can drill down into multiple 
layers of your report or create boardroom quality graphs and charts.

While you may not need every single report available in a particular retail 
software package, you do want to choose the retail software package with the 
most flexibility. Retail software that integrates with the industry-leading 
Crystal Reports® engine offer the most customization capabilities. If you want 
to be able to customize the built-in reports or create your own reports from 
scratch, make sure that the retail software you choose can handle it.

 What type of database should I 
choose? 

Answer: Any retail software package with inventory management and reporting 
features will have some underlying database. This database is where all of your 
items, customers, and sales history are stored. The underlying databases differ 
among various software manufacturers.

The key to choosing the right database lies in its format. You want to choose 
a broadly-understood data format that offers compatibility with third-party 
software applications. With the right data format, you can view your data just 
about any way you want to. For example, a retail software based on Microsoft 
SQL may offer compatibility with Crystal Reports® or Microsoft® Excel. 
Compatibility with third-party applications gives you unlimited reporting and 
analysis options.

Be sure choose a database architecture that ensures data integrity, so you 
know your data will always be accurate and reliable.

 Why is scalability important in 
retail software? 

Answer: A scalable retail software package will grow with you as your 
business grows. Choose a retail point of sale system that can readily 
accommodate additional users, additional workstations, and additional stores. 
When considering your future growth, keep in mind features you may one day 
need, such as multi-currency support or support for multiple tax rates across 
different regions. If history is a concern, make sure that the retail software 
you choose can store years and years of data.

 What is PCI DSS and why is it so 
important? 

Answer: PCI DSS, or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, is a 
strict set of standards designed to protect the cardholder's data from credit 
card fraud and misuse. ThePCI Security Standards Council 
 is an organization dedicated to the 
development and implementation of security standards for protecting credit card 
data. PCI Data Security Standards are developed and implemented by a 
collaborative effort from American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, 
MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa International.

If your retail software isn't compliant with PCI DSS, you may be subject to 
hefty fines. It's critical that you choose PCI-compliant retail software that 
will protect your customers' credit card information as well as your business.

Learn more about the 12 requirements of PCI DSS 
.

 How important are backups? 

Answer: Backups are critical. They protect your valuable business information 
from the unforeseen. Disasters—from hurricanes and floods to system failure or 
theft—can strike anyone, anytime, anywhere. Choose a retail POS system with 
easy-to-perform backup procedures. Keep a running log of your backups and make 
sure that someone is responsible the backups. It's also important to store your 
backups off site.

Learn more about keeping your retail software healthy 
.

 If my server goes down, can the 
clerks continue ringing up sales? 

Answer: If you want your clerks to be able to process sales without a server, 
choose retail software with lane redundancy or an offline mode. When point of 
sale workstations are 'offline' (i.e., not connected to the server), clerks can 
continue ringing up sales. When the connection to the server is reestablished, 
data from the local workstation is synchronized or replicated with the data on 
the server.

Offline POS systems can also work well for sidewalk sales, portable kiosks, 
and scheduled network outages.

 Do I need a software subscription 
service? 

Answer: Yes. When you purchase new retail software, you get the latest 
software release that's available on the date you purchase it. As new features 
are added to the retail software in subsequent releases, only those users with 
active subscription services will receive those updates. And no matter how good 
the retail software is, it may have a few bugs in it all.

Your subscription service will provide you with product updates, new 
features, and bug fixes for as long as your subscription service is active. 
Subscription services also encourage software companies to continue to invest 
resources in improving their retail software.

 I want a web store. Should I use a 
separate system for my ecommerce store? 

Answer: No. You should choose retail software with integrated ecommerce 
features. With an integrated system, you can use one retail software package to 
manage both your web store and your brick-and-mortar stores. An integrated 
ecommerce solution eliminates the extra effort and expense of maintaining 
inventory in multiple systems. If ecommerce is important to your business,learn 
more about ecommerce .

 How do I choose a vendor? 

Answer: Talk to more than one technology vendor. Just talking to vendors 
doesn't cost a thing, and you'll learn a lot about retail software and point of 
sale systems in the process. Don't just consider the retail POS systems 
available from each vendor. You also need to consider the vendor's location, 
areas of expertise, and number of years in business. Does the vendor offer 
extended support hours if you need them? If you have stores in multiple 
regions, can your vendor support all of your stores? Make sure that the vendor 
you choose can grow with you as your business grows.

Most importantly, choose a company you trust. The company you choose will be 
responsible for keeping your retail point of sale system running for the next 
5-7 years.

 Should I buy or lease a retail POS 
system? 

Answer: Whether you buy or lease a retail point of sale system depends on 
your budget. Many technology vendors today offer flexible leasing options for 
retail POS systems, including 100% financing. By leasing the retail software 
and/or the point of sale hardware, you can reduce the initial start-up costs 
associated with a new retail point of sale system.

Choosing A Retail Computer System

Your choice in a retail point of sale system is vital to the success and 
stability of your business. It is the hub around which everything revolves. You 
should have confidence in – and receive performance from – the system that is 
ultimately responsible for customer transactions, inventory management and 
every other action in your supply chain and tracking.



Let's walk through some important questions you should ask yourself when 
choosing a Retail System:

What Type Of Business Are You?

POS Systems are typically grouped in 2 separate categories: 
Restaurant/Hospitality and Retail. Restaurants are somewhat of a different 
breed – the focus of this article is Retail POS Systems.

Within the retail sector, pricing on Point Of Sale Systems can range from a 
couple hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. There are POS systems 
customized for every type of business under the sun, fromGift Shops 
 and Mall Kiosks 
 to Pet Stores 
 and Bike Shops 
.

Custom features are great BUT, the most important feature of your retail 
system is that it's easy to use. What good is a feature if it's too hard to use 
or buried among so many other features that you can't find it? Business owners 
are opting for simple, streamlined retail POS systems that focus on 
fundamentals and deliver them flawlessly. This is why so many entrepreneurs are 
turning toweb based point of sale systems 
 to fulfill their 
retail computer needs.

What POS Computers & Software Are Best For Me?

Do you prefer Windows? Mac OS X 
? Perhaps 
Linux? You can find great POS Systems that are equally powerful on any of these 
platforms, so choose the platform with which you're already the most 
comfortable.

In the past, POS systems were typically installed on business computers as 
software packages, much like Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint come packaged 
on Windows computers. Unfortunately, software based POS Systems present many 
problems and vulnerabilities that small and medium sized business have found 
overwhelming.

What about software updates? What if my computer breaks? How do I backup and 
save all my data? What if the platform needs patches or problems are found in 
the operating system or software?

These are questions you shouldn't have to deal with as a business owner — 
after all, why invest in a POS System that creates even more questions and 
uncertainties? Web based retail systems are solving these problems for many 
small retailers.

Advantages of Web Based Retail Systems


 * Software features and improvements are continually added and updated 
automatically. You never deal with software updates, downloads and changes. 
Someone else takes care of it for you. 
 * Because the solution is web based, you can access your inventory from any 
internet enabled computer in the world. A computer breaking becomes an 
incredibly minor problem. 
 * What happens if your computer crashes and it cannot be fixed? With a web 
based POS your information is continuously saved to a remote location that can 
be recovered even if your actual computer cannot be. Do You Have a Dedicated 
Retail IT Department?

Probably not! What small business can afford dedicating employees solely to 
managing their computers?

When something goes wrong with your system, how long can you afford for your 
business to be “down”? How long will it take to explain your problem via 
telephone or e-mail and to be walked through the steps? How long will it take 
for an IT professional to arrive to fix your POS System?

That's one of the beauties of a web based point of sale – experts can log 
into your system and fix the problem for you. This alleviates many of the 
support problems inherent of typical desktop software-based point of sale 
systems.

POS Bundles or Mix and Match?

If you're a brand new business or implementing a POS System for the first 
time, you can buy a package that will include every component needed to get up 
and running immediately… from your computer to your barcode scanners and 
receipt printer. You can realize great discounts for buying an all-inclusive 
bundle and for many entrepreneurs, this is the best idea.

Other companies may have existing hardware they'd like to use with their new 
system. Or, they may be cost conscious companies looking to achieve 
affordability through the purchase of refurbished hardware and use of existing 
hardware.

So What's The Bottom Line?

While companies seeking POS Systems are typically looking for customized 
hardware and traditional software bundles, small and medium sized businesses 
“in the know” prefer web based POS solutions for their flexibility, 
affordability and overall ability to deliver great results with premium service.

Questions about OEM, ACADEMIC, and RETAIL BOX set versions WHAT IS OEM, AE, 
RETAIL SOFTWARE?

If you have questions on the difference between OEM, AE, and Retail Box Set 
products, this page should be helpful.


Software Type Retail BOX Manuals Software Features Manufacturer Support 
Retail Box Set YES YES YES YES Retail Box Set (AE- Academic) YES YES YES NO 
(some software company will give limited support) Academic Software (AE) NO 
Online-Manual (some product may come with the manual/some may not) YES NO(some 
software company will give limited support) Original Equipment Manufacturer 
(OEM) NO Online-Manual (some products may come with the manual/ some may not) 
YES, most OEM products include all features available in the Retail version of 
the software. We have reports thatMicrosoft has been known to take certain 
features out of OEM versions 
. NO 
Academic(AE) and OEM version software are distributed from the original 
manufacturer of the product, but have no original manufacturer support. The 
software carries the same features and online help-manuals as with an original 
RETAIL box set version. AE and OEM can both be registered with the 
manufacturer, but receives no product support from the manufacturer (i.e. 
Microsoft, Corel, Lotus) because it is sold at a discounted price. 

To sum it all up, when you purchase an Academic (non-retail box set) or OEM 
version of a product the 3 factors that you lose from a RETAIL BOX set version 
would be the following:

(1)Original Manufacturer Support for the Software, (2)Retail BOX, and 
(3)Manual (most products come with the online-manual and some may come with the 
original manual).

Part 1 -   About 
Automated Sales And Inventory Control 

  

 Exactly what is a point-of-sale system?

A Retail Point of Sales system typically includes a computer, monitor, cash 
drawer, receipt printer, customer display and a barcode scanner, and the 
majority of retail POS systems also include a debit/credit card reader. It can 
also include a weight scale, an integrated credit card processing connection 
and a customer pin pad device. More and more POS monitors use touch-screen 
technology for ease of use and a computer is built in to the monitor chassis 
for what is referred to as an all-in-one unit. All-in-one POS units save 
valuable counter space for the retailer. The POS system software can typically 
handle a myriad of customer based functions such as sales, returns, exchanges, 
layaways, gift cards, customer reward programs, BOGO (buy one get one), 
quantity discounts and much more. POS software can also allow for functions 
such as date sensitive promotional sales, foreign currency handling and 
multiple payment types.

The POS unit handles the sales to the consumer but it is only one part of the 
entire POS system used in a retail business. Other functions of the POS system 
include inventory control, purchasing, receiving and transferring of products 
to and from other locations. Other functions of a POS system are to maintain 
sales information for reporting purposes as well as customer information for 
receivables management, marketing and specific buying analysis. Many retail POS 
systems include an accounting interface that “feeds” cash flow and cost of 
goods information to an accounting package.

What are the benefits of computerizing a store?

The number one job in retail, of course, is serving the customer. A point of 
sale system is a tool which makes that job faster, easier and more profitable, 
but there has to be a cost benefit to computerizing. With today's technology 
the benefit is there as long as the retailer commits to using a system's full 
potential. Computerizing your business does not necessarily give you an 
advantage over your competitors - you may have to do it simply to stay 
competitive. Three areas where immediate benefits can be seen are:

- Increased margins due to better inventory management and reduced shrinkage.
- Increased sales due to prompted suggestion selling, staff performance 
tracking and targeted marketing.
- Speed and accuracy in the chores surrounding reports, invoicing, purchase 
orders and inventory control.

Is it best to start with the accounting system and tackle inventory control 
later?

Computerizing the accounting functions will have a very small impact on your 
profitability but inventory is your number one asset. Managing it well is a key 
factor to business success. Good inventory control means balancing the 
expectations of your customers and your bankers, so you have to avoid being 
either under or over stocked. Some systems offer both inventory control and 
accounting modules but most successful retailers use completely different 
systems for each one. This is because software that tries to do it all usually 
ends up doing some of it badly, and the few that don't are extremely expensive. 
If you computerize your inventory control first you will get a much better 
return on your systems investment. Timely details about sales, inventory, 
invoicing, margins, orders and customers will help you earn more money than a 
new accounting system will save.

Is taking inventory more complicated once a POS system is installed?

No, it can be done much faster and more accurately if the POS system can read 
data from a hand-held barcode reader. These units are carried to where the 
stock is and the counts are scanned or punched in. The information is later 
transferred to the computer by cable. The computer then pops up a table showing 
where the shelf counts do not match the computer data and gives you a chance to 
correct it quickly and easily.

What are the advantages of having bar codes on the stock?

Barcodes greatly increase the integrity of the point-of-sale transactions. If 
cash personnel have to enter a stock code for each POS transaction the chances 
of making mistakes are higher. Good retail management software should print 
barcode labels in two sizes and can automatically print a label for every item 
in the last shipment. Since the UPC barcode is industry assigned, you should 
use another barcode scheme for your own stock such as Code39. There is no 
problem associated with having UPC and Code39 labels in the same store because 
barcode scanners can auto-recognise which type of label they are reading.

What reports should we look for in a good system?

There should be a dozen to choose from, though most retailers use only three 
of four on a regular basis. Which ones you use will depend on the nature and 
style of your business. Better systems can limit the scope of a report to a 
given department, supplier, stock code range, etc.

Does entering a customer name and address take too long and annoy the 
customer?

It might, and it is important to be very sensitive to a customer's reluctance. 
However, this information is so valuable that not trying to gather it may be a 
mistake. Experience shows that it costs a lot more to get a new customer into 
your store than getting an old one back. This kind of marketing has proven to 
be the most cost-effective way to drive up sales. Better software systems allow 
for a variety of customer data and mailing capabilities which can identify 
customers by last purchase date, birthday, purchase history, customer type and 
salesperson. This is powerful information for the retailer because it gives us 
the ability to target promotions where they count, measure advertising results, 
purge inactive names from mailing lists and do follow-up phone calls. Once 
people are in the system they do not have to be re-entered, but can be called 
up by name, phone number, company or customer number. A good system will also 
give you the option to avoid re-typing the city, state and zip code for every 
new customer.

How long does it take to get a point of sale system up and running?

The setup phase can be a headache if it is not properly planned and then 
rushed through. Don't decide on Saturday that the system has to be installed 
and fully integrated into the business by Monday. Allow lots of time for you 
and your staff to get used to a new routine. It would be ideal to run the new 
system in tandem with the old one for a week or more, but this is a luxury that 
many stores cannot indulge in. The POS system should start providing useful 
information about inventory control and customers after a month of full-time 
use.

Part 3 - A Few Management Tips From The Pros 
  

1 - Buying Strategies And Dealing With Suppliers 

To be successful in retail, it is essential to stock the right products, at 
the right time and at the right price. To do this, you must be able to source 
your products from the best and most reliable supplier that you can. This is 
not always an easy thing to do. Obviously you need to establish the product 
lines you are going to sell from a supplier that will be consistent and 
reliable.

 Identifying your Niche

Before you begin the process of sourcing your stock, it is always a good idea 
to visit a competitors store to see what they are stocking and what price 
levels they are retailing at. Try to gain some idea of the brand names that are 
being sold and decide which seem to be the highest selling lines. It is always 
a good idea to have a look in their reduction sections to get an idea of which 
items are not selling quite as well and are being sold off cheaply.

 It may be possible that the retailer will talk with you. This is more easily 
achieved if they are some distance from your location and therefore not a 
retailer you will be in direct competition with. If they will talk to you, 
attempt to get an idea from them of which items sell best and at which times of 
the year. What sort of pricing strategy do they have? Do they offer multiple 
price deals on new products to introduce them etc? What items don’t sell too 
well? Remember, just because items don’t sell too well for them, it doesn’t 
mean they won’t for you.

 Once you have established your product range, or at least a broad knowledge 
of a product range, it is time to search for the products. It may be a good 
idea at this stage to visit some trade exhibitions or shows to broaden your own 
knowledge of the particular product range you have chosen. You may find that 
newer versions of products are about to be released onto the market. Having 
this knowledge can help in two ways. Firstly, it gives you an opportunity to 
source a new product range other retailers may not have discovered yet and 
secondly, you could use this information to your advantage and reduce your 
prices down for the stock that will be replaced with newer versions. This can 
be done more gradually and with greater effect if it is carried out in advance 
of the new products arrival.

 Careful consideration of your supplier is important to any retail business. 
You need to be able to make sure you have a supplier that will not let you 
down. You simply will not be satisfied with a supplier who will raise prices 
with little or no reason just as soon as you have become reliant on them. Check 
out reviews for their service where you can.

 

Sourcing Your Goods

Suppliers come in many different types. Briefly, you can purchase from 
Manufacturers, Importers, Distributors, Wholesalers and even from Auctions. 
Each of these sources have plusses and minuses.

Manufacturers - It can sometimes be beneficial to approach manufacturers 
directly. Often they will sell directly to the retailer, but to do so the 
manufacturer will usually expect large bulk orders. In some rare instances 
exclusivity can also be obtained which will ensure an extra possibility of 
success in your business. If a manufacturer will not sell to you directly, then 
you should ask them for a list of their distributors.

Importers - Buying direct from importers can hold serious advantages, but 
also serious disadvantages. You can get the best prices, buying foreign goods 
directly from an importer, but you should take into account shipping 
timeframes, product life cycles, tax and duties and other associated problems.

Distributors - They sell large varieties of products at slightly higher 
prices than the manufacturers. It is possible to buy smaller quantities with 
little or no minimum quantities. Often items will be shipped for free.

Wholesalers - This type of supplier most often gives the best price for you 
to pass on to the customer. They usually have a large range of products and you 
will find a large amount of merchandise at the best possible prices. 
Wholesalers will often sell pallet loads of items and even truck loads. There 
are often terms and conditions attached to certain sales, as with any purchase.

Auctions - You can buy items from Auction sites such as Ebay or from Auction 
companies where stock is being sold off in bulk. Often you will find large 
bankrupt stocks available at low prices. This is not a consistent supply of 
stock items though and should be considered as a one off supply.

 

Identifying Potential Suppliers

When you have identified the products you want to stock, you need to identify 
the best possible vendor for your retail business. You need to be able to find 
a vendor that will supply products to you at the best possible price. These 
products need to be of the best quality and the vendor must be able to 
guarantee delivery times and be reliable when they commit to delivery. Problems 
normally do occur and the company must be able to back you up that eventuality 
with the best possible Customer Service.

  

Ask The Supplier Some Questions

What is their minimum order quantity? - If they insist on a large order 
quantity, you could end up with a better price overall, but if the products 
don’t sell well, this could result in large items of stock and future sales at 
a significant loss. Will the supplier negotiate over order quantities? It is 
always worth asking.

Who else sells their products? - Try to discover if there are other local 
retailers being supplied with goods by the same company. It won’t be 
progressive to be in direct competition with other local suppliers.

Question them about promotional items or off price products - The vendors 
will often mark down their products, just as the retailer will. It is always 
worth asking the supplier if they are willing to sell items to you in this way.

Are the items you are ordering re-orderable? - Sometimes vendors’ stock items 
that are simply bulked up in their warehouses and when the stock is exhausted 
they won’t be selling any more of this stock. 

If items don’t sell, will the supplier exchange products for other more 
saleable ones? - Its worth asking the vendor if this is a possibility. Always 
make sure though that if they do agree that this is written down clearly in the 
Terms and Conditions.

What is the delivery timeframe? How long will goods take to arrive? Do you 
have to order in advance and book delivery dates significantly ahead?

What are the terms of payment? Do products have to be paid for upfront or is 
it possible to create an account with the vendor and be billed on a specific 
date each month.

You can find out about the supplier’s reputation through references or simply 
by questioning sales reps and other clients.

 

Pricing Your Products

Finding the correct price point is of paramount importance for your retail 
business. Pricing a product too high will deter your customers, pricing an item 
too low and you will lose profits or even money along with in certain instances 
the customer’s ‘perceived value’ of the goods.

Take a look at local retail outlets and see what sort of price point’s that 
similar goods are set at. Always attempt to fix your prices as close to these 
as possible. Think about employing promotions which allow items to be reduced 
by a certain percentage or where products can be given away for free with the 
purchase of other products. Your supplier may run promotions now and then which 
you could take advantage of, selling products on a similar cost level to your 
customers. This could attract both new and existing consumers.

 Have you considered a customer loyalty card? Customers that spend a 
specified amount of money can receive a discount amount off their next 
purchase. Incentive shopping is often seen as a good way of ensuring return 
custom.

 Primary importance should be given to your sales history. Learning from the 
products you have already bought for your retail business, which have been 
successful or unsuccessful is a very valuable aspect of buying stock. The next 
time you go to purchase more, go to the supplier with the knowledge gathered 
and you will be in a much stronger and more confident position.

2 - Secrets of Niche Market Domination 
  

 The 20-Percent Rule

The saying goes that 20-percent of buyers consume 80-percent of your product 
volume. If we are to prove the saying true, we need to find out who the 
20-percenters are and target our products directly at them. The 20-percenters 
are the niche market and as a small retailer, you need to dominate these 
markets in order to make a healthy profit. Let’s take a look at how you can do 
this.

 

Pay Attention to Secondary Data Sources

Most large companies already segment their customers into niche markets, so 
it stands to reason that as a small retailer, you should be doing the same 
thing. Rather than spend huge amounts of cash to figure out what niche markets 
you should be catering to, it might be a more prudent idea to check secondary 
data sources. These secondary sources could be industry experts, trade 
associations or even data that you gather on your own for things other than 
market research. An example of this type of data might be a sales report that 
is sub-ivided by each product line.

  

Copy the Competition

Another strategy that you can incorporate involves watching your key 
competitors. Remember the old saying “Keep your friends close and your enemies 
closer?” This is exactly what you should be doing. Keep an eye on what your 
competitors are doing when it comes to marketing and if it looks like it’s 
working, then copy them.

  

Create a Buzz

If you’re interested in creating buzz about a particular product that you’ll 
be introducing, be sure to talk with key trade buyers. Word of mouth will help 
sell your product to those 20-percenters we were talking about. It doesn’t hurt 
to do a needs analysis based on research that you conduct in-store with 
individuals or groups of customers. People who enjoy buying stuff are always 
happy to talk about the things that they want.

  

Do What the Big Companies Do

Search for secondary data in the same places that the large companies do. In 
most cases, you can get direct access to the same databases that huge 
corporations do. This data can be used to estimate the size of different market 
segments and how important they might be. Check in trade publications and 
association publications as well as with experts involved in these particular 
areas. You can also gain access to larger market research information through 
companies like Burk, Information Resources, Inc. and ACNielsen.

  

Segment, Segment, Segment

One final thing to keep in mind while you’re doing your research is that you 
can segment markets by geography, product life, distribution, packaging, price, 
sizes and other tangible elements that you know about your products.

  

Dominate the Competition

Okay, so you’ve figured out which market segments you’re going to attack and 
you have all the data you can handle. The next step is to figure out who’s 
trying to take your customers away from you. It’s important to identify who 
will be in direct competition with you before you make a final decision about 
which niche market to jump into. If you do this, you’ll be reducing risk, 
resources and expenses.

 

For example, you may have a new and unique shoe that you want to sell. 
Unfortunately, competing with every shoe retailer in a multi-billion dollar 
product category is monumentally difficult. Secondarily, if you narrow the 
market down to a single style of shoe, you may still be dealing with a billion 
dollar product category. However, if you target a specific niche, for instance 
one particular style of orthopedic men’s dress shoes, the market segment 
becomes smaller and much easier to break into with a new product.

  

Undercut the Competition

Once you’ve identified your competitors, it’s time to undercut them. Niche 
markets can be finicky and they may only be able to support one company in that 
niche. When pricing your product lower than your competitor, it’s important to 
be the first company that settles into this low-price area. It’s also important 
to have secondary sources of service and product differences with your 
competitors.

  

Position Your Product

A final way to dominate your niche is to provide a clear and targeted 
positioning message. You must position your product as unique and different 
from your competitor’s product. Examine what you offer against other products 
that your 20-percenters are buying. If there are no differences, create some. 
Secondly, position your product correctly with your target audience by solving 
the equation of product + advertising + price + distribution. If you get this 
mix right based on your research and how you differentiate your business and 
your product from your competition, you’ll dominate the niche market that 
you’ve chosen.

 3 - Staying On Top In An Economic Downturn 
  

 Small retailers, whether online or on Main Street, are often the first 
businesses to feel the effects of an economic downturn. In many cases, a 
smaller retail business is unable to compete with the pricing that the larger 
big box department stores get, and customers are forced to buy at the lower 
prices of the big stores. But there are things that a smaller retailer can do 
to survive in a bad economy. With some imagination and a grass roots effort 
that includes your best customers spreading the word, a small business can even 
grow in a bad economy.

  

Customer Referrals

The first thing a small retail business needs to do is get its customers 
involved in referring new clients in a bad economy. Start giving out business 
cards to all of your customers with spaces on the back to write their name and 
contact information. Have your customers hand those cards out to anyone they 
know to encourage those people to visit your store. The card offers a 10 
percent discount to your new customers, and it pays your referring customer 
$10. Word of mouth is one of the strongest forms of advertising, and a small 
cash reward can inspire your clients to start sending a slew of new customers 
your way. Make sure that the card states that the 10 percent discount is only 
for the first order, and the $10 reward is only paid once for each new client.

  

Add More Value

When clients are given a better value, then they tend to shop at a smaller 
store more often. One of the problems that people often encounter when shopping 
at a larger retail store is the lack of knowledgeable personnel available to 
assist customers with buying decisions. A smaller retail store should take the 
time to educate the staff so that customers can be assisted immediately with 
accurate answers to product questions.

Set up a small table at a central location in the store where customers can 
stop and ask questions about any of the products that you offer. If necessary, 
your customer service people should go into the store and find the product 
rather than making the customer bring the product to them. Customer service 
changes that may seem small to the store owner, but make the shopping 
experience smoother and more pleasant for the client, can make a difference 
during bad economic times. It allows the smaller retail store to make the 
customer feel appreciated, which can get lost with larger retail stores.

  

Share Advertising Costs

A smaller retail store should not stop advertising during difficult economic 
times. When the economy is bad, that is when consumers start combing the retail 
advertising in the newspaper even closer to try and find deals. One way a small 
retail store can help its own cause is by teaming up with other retail stores 
and splitting advertising costs. Stores that offer complimentary products can 
pool their resources and lower their individual advertising costs while 
maintaining their advertising presence. For example, a record store can team up 
with a stereo store to work on advertising to help drive traffic to both 
locations.

  

Customer Dedication

There will always be economic downturns that small retail businesses will 
need to address. But with some creative thinking, and some hard work and 
customer dedication, a small retail store can make the customer feel important 
and work to take some of that business from the big box retailers that can do 
not have the resources to make the customer feel special.

filling the job. This is an important benchmark against which to measure future 
performance, especially if lack of performance forces you to fire an employee.

Keystone: Retailing term that sets a selling price for merchandise at double 
its cost. If you buy an item at $10.00 and sell is at $20.00, you are marking 
it up at keystone. If you are selling at $30.00, that’s double keystone.

Kiosk: Booth or stall set up in a shopping center to sell goods. May be

Layaway: Storing merchandise for a customer for a later purchase usually 
requiring a deposit and a time limit for complete payment to be made.

Letter of credit (L/C): An agreement from the bank assuring a vendor that it 
will be paid for the merchandise once it is delivered according to preset 
specifications regardless of the buyer’s financial condition, thus eliminating 
the seller’s risk. The buyer has to have adequate credit to satisfy the bank 
and pays the bank a small commission for this guarantee.

Liabilities: Amount owed including accounts payable, loans, credit card debt, 
taxes due, etc. Short-term liabilities are those that have to be paid within 
twelve months. Long-term liabilities are those due in more than twelve months.

Licensing: Fee paid to use a name, product, or know-how for a given period of 
time and in a specified geographical area.

Life cycle: Many products go through four phases between market introduction 
and eventual demise: introduction (birth); maturity (middle age); decline (old 
age); and death. Thus, like people, products have a lifecycle.

Limited Liability Company (LLC): Form of corporate structure that provides 
business owners with personal liability protection but taxes corporate profits 
or losses at the individual level.

Limited partner: A partner who invests money but does not participate in the 
daily operations of the business. This partner is liable only for the amount of 
money invested. The general partner runs the business and is paid for his

financial instruments (e.g., stocks and bonds).

Marketing: Process associated with the selling of goods or services to more 
people than you can approach personally. The art and science of marketing 
includes product development, package and logo design, pricing, market research 
(to determine the consumer acceptance of these aspects of the product), 
advertising, sales promotion, merchandising, and public relations to make 
people aware of the product.

Market niche: Defined segment of the market with a need for a particular 
product or service.

that category of products in a defined area (i.e., a single store, a town,

buying their products.

Merchandising: Selecting, pricing, displaying, and advertising items for sale

be members of a family.

Net income: Money left over after all expenses.

Net 30: Credit terms extended by a supplier where the retailer pays the full 
amount of the purchase within 30 days of shipment.

Non-compete clause: An agreement employees or suppliers sign indicating they 
won’t use your ideas or business methods on behalf of a competitor or start 
their own business in direct competition to you. Non-competes are tricky. If 
you try to tie an employee up too tightly, the courts may hold that you are 
depriving that employee of the ability to earn a livelihood, and will strike 
down the contract. Generally, the more you pay the employee for the non-compete 
and the more limited its scope, the more enforceable it will be.

Off price: Merchandise that is purchased for less than regular price.

Off-price retailing: Stores offering well-known brands of merchandise at 
substantially lower prices compared to conventional stores handling the same 
brands.

Open to Buy: Most retailers establish a maximum level of inventory they can 
afford to have on hand. The Open to Buy is the amount of merchandise the 
retailer can still buy before reaching that ceiling.

Opportunistic buy: Buying products at far below their original price because 
a vendor is overstocked.

that were previously performed in-house by employees.

Partnership: Formed when two or more people share ownership of a business.

Planogram: Structured plan for displaying a line of merchandise on the shelf 
so as to maximize their visibility and sale. For example, a store might have a 
planogram for its detergents that would specify that Tide (its bestseller) had, 
say, ten shelf facings while lesser brands had fewer. By following the 
planogram, restocking shelves remains orderly and as planned.

Point of Sale (POS): Computer register system used to record sales by item, 
department, etc. The information is used to help make merchandising decisions 
and capture financial information.

Power retailers: Merchants with sufficient financial strength, marketing 
skills, and desirable content to enter any market they want.

Pre-paid: Vendor pays freight to store. 

Price point: Various price categories. For example, one price may be for good 
products, another for better products, and a third for best products.

by its price.

Price war: When two or more competitors try to beat each other’s prices, 
possibly intending to drive the weaker competitor out of business or, at least, 
reduce their business substantially. They undercut each other’s prices 
systematically, sometimes to such an extent that they are losin substantial 
sums of money on the price war “footballed” items.

Private label: Brands owned by a retailer or retail group rather than by a 
manufacturer.

Profit and loss statement (P & L): An accounting report that shows revenues, 
costs of goods, gross profit, expenses by major category (including 
depreciation and amortization), pre-tax profits, taxes, and after-tax profit.

Purchase order: The form used to place an order and give written 
authorization to a vendor to deliver specified merchandise at a stipulated 
price. Once accepted by the vendor, the purchase order becomes a legally 
binding purchase contract.

based on the size of the ad, the length of a commercial, the positions of the 
advertising within its medium, and how often it is repeated. 

Reach: Number of persons exposed at least once to a message during an ad 
campaign. 

Receiving: The physical process of taking possession of merchandise.

Resale number: State issued identification number that permits retailers to 
buy merchandise without the vendor having to pay sales tax. When the retailer 
then sells to a person or entity that has no resale number, the seller is 
required to collect the tax from the purchaser and pass it on to the state.

Returns: Products sent back to the vendor for refund or credit against future 
sales.

Run of paper (ROP): Newspaper advertising term that applies to advertisements 
that the publisher can place anywhere in the paper.

Sales rep: Person or company representing the manufacturer in the sale of its 
goods.

S corporation: A corporation whose profits and losses pass directly through 
its owner(s).

place orders at a trade show.

Shrinkage: Loss of merchandise at retail caused by shoplifting, internal 
theft, or bookkeeping errors.

lend money, it guarantees bank loans for small business people who could not 
otherwise qualify for them.

personally responsible (as compared to a corporation, the debts of which are 
normally not the responsibility of its owners, even if there is only a single 
owner).

 Shrink: the high cost of 
retail theft

Retailers are facing increased pressure on their profits from the high cost 
associated with shrink, which cost them $119.1 billion globally* in 2011. Not 
only does shrink erode retailers’ profits margins by as much as nearly 40%, it 
also wreaks havoc on shelf availability and inventory accuracy. And as industry 
research has shown, if customers can’t find the product they’re seeking at one 
store, they often buy it at a competitor's store or web site.

Checkpoint's benefits for retailers
Checkpoint's retail customers enjoy increased sales and profits by improving 
their supply chain efficiencies and providing a secure, open merchandising 
environment. Merchandise is not only protected from theft and shrink, but is 
available to consumers when they’re ready to purchase.

Retail Point of Sale System

RFP - Example Questions

RFP template      This Ready-to-Use RFP Master? is 
focused on selecting retail point of sale system software solutions,  and 
provides capabilities that go far beyond those of a traditional RFP limited to 
asking vendors simple Yes/No questions about software features. Specialized for 
use in complex information system environments, this RFP Master collects 
information from vendors about all aspects of the retail point of sale software 
implementation project they are proposing. 
    Actual screens and questions from this RFP  are shown below to illustrate 
how it enables you to easily collect the unique metrics needed to successfully 
identify, acquire, and implement the retail point of sale software solution 
best suited to your company's needs. 

This Retail POS RFP contains questions that query vendors about SaaS, Cloud 
Computing, Mobile POS, and other emerging capabilities to ensure the optimum 
fit to your current and future requirements.

IDENTIFY Feature AVAILABILITY & DELIVERABILITY. Unlike other RFPs, Infotivity 
RFP Masters automatically collect the information needed to identifyBOTH the 
AVAILABILITY of software features, and their DELIVERABILITY, i.e., HOW those 
features will be delivered. Each RFP Master includes a Feature Support Matrix? 
(FSM) to automatically capture this information, which can be used to create 
veryaccurate and reliable retail point of sale software system implementation 
schedules. View samples here.

Determine RISK and SUPPORTABILITY. RFP Masters automatically evaluate vendor 
response data collected to quantitatively determine the SUPPORTABILITY INDEX? 
of each proposed software system. This index ranks the potential support 
problems inherent in each proposal. Accurately compare the amount of ongoing 
support needed to keep each proposed POS software system up and running.

          A 
Detailed & Comprehensive List of:

Retail Point of Sale (POS) System Features

       Pre-defined retail point of sale RFP criteria ensure no important 
business requirements, mobile, cloud and software features "slip through the 
cracks".  All are in a quantitative format that guarantees vendor responses 
will be meaningful, consistent, and easy to compare. All questions are 
professionally prepared by application specialists to address BOTH the STANDARD 
features and EXCEPTION CASE software functions required. 

  



          
Identify BOTHPOS Software Features Availability and Deliverability 

       Unlike other RFPs that try (and fail) to gather useful solutions data 
about complex retail point of sale system features, RFP Masters are not 
constrained to the use of summary-level "Yes" or "No" answers. This RFP Master? 
uses a Feature Support Matrix? (FSM) that identify BOTH feature AVAILABILITY 
and DELIVERY Method. This RFP Master function is useful during both the retail 
point of sale software selection AND the system implementation phases of large 
projects because it enables effective Earned Value Management through detailed 
cross-referencing of usable software functionality and vendor invoicing. 





          
Determine the Risk & Supportability of Proposed

Retail POS Solutions

       Unlike other RFPs, an RFP Master can illustrate potential support 
problems (and risk) inherent in vendor system proposals. The Feature Support 
Matrix? (FSM) used in each RFP Master? categorizes the inherent risk posed for 
each criteria, and uses that information to calculate the SUPPORTABILITY INDEX? 
for each vendor RFP response. For example, a feature delivered "out of the box" 
FULLY SUPPORTED is less risky than one delivered through custom programming, 
even if the programming is free. This RFP Master function is useful during both 
the software selection AND the implementation phases of a large retail point of 
sale system because it enables effective Earned Value Management through 
detailed cross-referencing of usable software functionality and vendor 
invoicing. 

  



          
Color-Coded, "Apples-to-Apples" Comparison of Proposed Retail Systems

POS Solution Comparison

       These comparison matrices automatically change vendor response cell 
background color to GREEN, YELLOW, or RED, to reflect how favorable each 
response is to your needs! Compared to the tedious task of reviewing hundreds 
of mono-color Yes/No answers, these colored responses allow problem areas to be 
spotted more easily, and risk assessment is made much more accurate. All 
required response comparison matrices are included and ready-to-use! Quickly 
and easily compare retail point of sale software system proposals side-by-side, 
feature by feature, in detailed comparisons you control! Keep your retail 
project on-schedule and under-budget.

Vendor Response Input Validation. 

       Vendors must answer each RFP question by choosing from a pre-defined 
list of possible responses. See below for an example of this drop-down list. 
This forces all vendors to respond to each retail point of sale (POS) software 
question in a consistent, standard manner. Eliminates the days of time 
typically wasted trying to compare the inconsistent or incomplete vendor 
responses obtained by using traditional, non-quantitative RFP questions! 
Ensures vendor proposals are easy to compare and evaluate!

Join Date: Nov 2009  Posts: 238 Question about Steamworks and PC retail box 
copy  I bought a PC box copy of BL2 through Gamestop (to get the pre-order 
bonuses). I'm wishing I'd just done this through Steam, since I generally 
reformat my computer several times per year for hardware upgrades and whatnot.

 With BL1, this turned into a constant headache trying to reinstall the game 
each time, find the physical disk, redo the DRM, and have the disk in the drive 
in order to play the game.

 I'm willing to give up my premiere club bonuses (and actually re-purchase the 
game through Steam if necessary) in order to get full Steam support of the 
title, including the ability to re-download the game after a new Windows 
install, as well as the ability to buy all the expansions through Steam itself.

 That being said, my question is: I know I will be registering using 
Steamworks on my retail disk copy... the FAQ mentions "full Steamworks support".

 After registering my disk with Steamworks, can I use Steam for everything 
else (including later re-downloads and future content purchases), or must I 
purchase the title through Steam itself in order to do this? BL1 would only let 
you buy the expansions through Steam if you had purchased the game FROM Steam.

 Sorry for the wordy post, and thanks in advance for any help. The bad part of 
running your own business is I haven't even had time to install my game yet. 
The good part is I don't mind buying another copy to get this done how I want 
it. I'd just like to keep my Premiere Club bennies through all this if I can.

box copy  It a Steam game. Once you input the key it's in your Steam library. 
You don't need the disk. You can DL it off Steam anytime you want to, on any 
computer on your account. In other words..It just like you brought it off Steam 
digitally

Steamworks and PC retail box copy  For future reference as well, you can get 
Steam to install from the disk so you don't have to sit through a re-download 
each time (this works for any Steamworks game).

 With Steam off and no game data for said game installed, open your Run prompt 
(Windows key + R) and type in:

 "E:\Games\Steam\Steam.exe" -install D:

 Leave the quotes intact and change the paths as necessary.

 Your game will then be installed and works like any other Steam downloaded 
game.  Last edited by Vaskania; September 20th, 2012 at 01:32 PM.

In July 2011, Gartner released a study 
 on worldwide mobile payment 
trends. In it, Gartner reported a striking 38 percent jump in mobile payment 
users from 2010 to 2011, to 141 million. Even so, the report notes that the 
market has been slow to develop, and mass market adoption may be more than four 
years away.

"The biggest hurdle is the need to change user behavior by convincing 
consumers to pay with mobile phones instead of cash and cards," says Gartner 
Research Director Sandy Shen in the press release on the report.

Calvin Grimes, mobile product manager at Fiserv , 
sees mobile payments addressing a problem consumers don’t realize they even 
have. Grimes notes it’s similar to how consumers used to think about mobile 
banking. “They didn’t realize they wanted it until they had it,” says Grimes. 
“Leading financial institutions pioneered the service–now it’s expected.”

Retailers can–and should–play a role in driving consumer adoption of mobile 
payments, and Eytan Wiener, COO ofQuantum Networks LLC 
, thinks retailers should act now rather than later: “It’s worth it for 
companies to get in on this technology early. Those that do will benefit 
long-term, and attract enthusiasts eager to try this out in stores.”

Retailers need to understand the technology and implications of mobile 
payments to avoid being caught flat-footed. Here are some answers to questions 
retailers frequently ask to get you started.

The Basics

What are mobile payments?
 Mobile payments are monetary transactions facilitated through smartphones or 
other mobile devices, such as tablets. These payments are initiated by a 
virtual wallet communicating with merchant payment terminals at the point of 
sale.

What is the consumer-facing technology behind mobile payments?
 Consumers first register their credit card account with a virtual wallet 
application, such asGoogle Wallet  or the 
soon-to-be-releasedISIS application 

.Capable mobile devices  contain 
radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips that communicate with merchant 
terminals using a technology called near field communication (NFC). The devices 
communicate when in close proximity, establishing a “contactless payment” 
connection.

What do retailers need to accept mobile payments?
 Beyond the basic requirements to complete any credit card transaction (a 
merchant account, payment gateway, point of sale software, etc.), retailers 
must have either a standalone NFC-payment terminal or an integrated credit card 
machine that is ISO 14443-compatible. Standalone receivers can be purchased for 
a few hundred dollars; fully-integrated credit card machines are more expensive.

How do mobile payments benefit consumers versus using credit cards?
 The simplicity of paying by phone–which consumers carry anyway–is one of its 
main selling points. Theft prevention is also a benefit, as virtual wallets can 
be remotely wiped in the event a phone is lost or stolen. Finally, value-added 
services built into virtual wallets–such as integrated loyalty programs and 
couponing–are some of the proposed future benefits of mobile payments.

The Ecosystem

Who are the major players that retailers should be aware of?
 In the U.S., two players are spearheading mobile payment adoption: ISIS 
, a joint venture between Verizon, AT&T and 
T-Mobile USA, and Google, which is partnering with Sprint, Citi and MasterCard 
on its Google Wallet initiative. A third party to keep an eye on is PayPal, the 
e-commerce payment processor. PayPal is testing multiple new payment models 
across the world to increase its penetration into physical stores; theNFC 
technology its CEO once ridiculed 

 is currently being tested in Sweden.

How much will a mobile payment transaction “cost?”
 Today, mobile payments via smartphones cost the same as using current NFC 
payment technologies such as PayPass and payWave. Interchange rates are 
slightly higher for contactless payments than for traditional credit card 
payments although card companies could lower rates for NFC transactions like it 
did inItaly 
 back 
in 2010.

How is mobile payment security being addressed?
 Mobile device manufacturers and application developers will have to ensure 
devices are secure from hackers. NFC signals transmit at a range of only a few 
centimeters (and a maximum of a few meters, in some instances), and virtual 
wallets require authentication to complete payments. Applications with PIN 
passwords will inherently be safer than cards that are stolen and used 
elsewhere instantly. Security technology experts are also researching new ways 
to increase mobile payment security–such as creating single-use credit card 
numbers to destroy the value of skimmed virtual wallets.

The Merchant Opportunity

How will mobile payments be integrated with couponing and loyalty?
 Value-added services will undoubtedly drive consumer adoption of mobile 
payment platforms. The smartphone will eventually link mobile payments with 
retail mobile shopping applications such asShopKick  
(which allows shoppers to earn points for mobile check-ins at participating 
stores),PunchTab  (which rewards shoppers for 
purchases and for encouraging their social networks to shop at specific stores) 
andRedLaser  (to scan QR and barcodes at stores for more 
product information), among others.

For example, shoppers could check-in to specific store areas to receive 
targeted offers and immediately complete the sale; they could track their 
rewards points directly within their virtual wallet at the point of sale; or 
consumers could receive a coupon on their phone immediately after scanning a QR 
code or making a purchase. The idea is that a mobile payment is the final step 
to completing a soup-to-nuts mobile shopping experience.

Does point of sale technology selection have to change?
 Most retailers will only have to update credit card terminals during their 
next upgrade cycle to offer mobile payment processing. Other than that, most of 
the innovation will be within smartphone applications, not point-of-sale 
hardware or software.

What should a retailer do to prepare for the mobile payments movement?
 Have a vision in place. Merchants, retailers, financial institutions and 
consumers are all playing a game of chicken right now–waiting for one of the 
parties to take the biggest step forward. For starters, retailers can stay 
on-top of payments in the news, as well as testing the waters with technologies 
such asGoogle Places . Additionally, stay alert 
if your community is adopting NFC elsewhere, such as Boston’sNFC inniaitive 
within taxi cabs 
.

These answers should answer most retailers’ questions, but others will 
undoubtedly arise as mobile payments become more prevalent. Feel free to leave 
a note below if you have a question not answered in our FAQ, or contact me 
directly.

An additional thanks to Mutual Mobile 's Rachel 
Youens  for her insight.

 *  Asked by Gregory C from Minneapolis 
 *  Mar 20, 2013  2 Answers  


Best Answer

 Depends on your Mac's processor. 

If it is a PowerPC processor, you CAN NOT install Snow Leopard. 

If it is an Intel processor, you CAN install Snow Leopard. 

To determine the type of processor, go to "About this Mac" in the "Apple" 
menu. If the word "Intel" appears anywhere next to "Processor", you can install 
Snow Leopard. You need at least 1GB of memory, 2GB or more is better.

TIP: Consider installing Snow Leopard on a separate partition (especially 
since Snow Leopard may need to do some reformatting of the partition it is 
being installed to). With an OS installed on two partitions, you can then start 
up from either the Tiger partition or the Snow Leopard partition by pressing 
the Option Key during startup (or using the Start Up Disk preference in System 
Preferences). This lets you keep you OS 10.4.11 installation in case you want 
to jump back.

BTW: If installing to a new partition, Snow Leopard installer will search your 
Mac for other OS installations and ask you if you want to import OS settings, 
apps, and/or files from an older installation. Say yes to all for a smoother 
transition to Snow Leopard. All settings, compatible apps/drivers and files 
will be copied to the new partition. …More

Q: I only have one retail store. I'd like to use a computer and software, but 
don't know if Microsoft Business Solutions Retail Management System is a good 
fit. Also, can I use my laptop computer? 

A: Microsoft Retail Management System Store Operations can run at just one 
store or at multiple stores. There's no requirement to have multiple retail 
stores before purchasing Microsoft Retail Management System Store Operations. 
The software, however, is designed to scale should your retail operation begin 
to grow into multiple locations. And, Microsoft Retail Management System can 
run on any Microsoft Windows-based computer?laptop or desktop?provided it meets 
the minimum requirements for installation and operation. Learn more about 
minimum requirements and see a listing of capable hardware providers.

Top of page 


Q: I have a growing retail business with six stores, 20 employees, and about 
$10 million US in sales. Can I use Microsoft Retail Management System in more 
than one store? 

A: Yes. Microsoft Retail Management System offers an application called 
Headquarters that allows retailers with a small chain of stores to centralize 
control of their Store Operations databases and reporting. For instance, if you 
had six stores and a head office, you would have six licenses for Store 
Operations (each store with its own database) and one license for Headquarters 
at the head office.

Q: I currently use a cash register to track my sales and store cash. Does 
Microsoft Retail Management System work with my cash register, or do I need to 
replace it? 

A: Microsoft Retail Management System does not run on traditional cash 
registers. Instead, this easy-to-use software application is installed on a 
Windows-based computer with point-of-sale peripherals attached via the 
available ports on the computer. (It does not run on Apple computers.) You'll 
need to replace your cash register with computers, which are easy to use and 
reliable. When used with our software, they allow you to do more than you could 
with a cash register. You can manage time-consuming tasks efficiently and help 
increase profits as a result. Like an electronic cash register, Microsoft 
Retail Management System is used by cashiers or sales associates to ring up 
orders and tender sales, but it also provides more.

Top of page 


Q: Other than the software, what other equipment will I need to purchase? 

A: At a very minimum, you'll need a computer with a standard keyboard, mouse, 
and monitor. (Remember, Microsoft Retail Management System runs on a Windows 
platform.) Most point-of-sale (POS) registers using Microsoft Retail Management 
System also have a standard 40-column receipt printer, a scanner to read 
barcodes, a cash drawer to store cash and various tenders, and a pole display 
to let the customers view and verify the item prices and transaction total. 
Other hardware available for use with Microsoft Retail Management System 
includes full-page printers, scales, magnetic stripe readers, magnetic ink 
character recognition readers, signature capture device, PIN pads for accepting 
debit cards, touch screen monitors, and dual display monitors. To determine 
what hardware you will need, check the hardware compatibility list, which 
specifies manufacturers and models of each type of device that is known to work 
with Microsoft Retail Management System Store Operations. Most of these POS 
devices require an Object Linking and Embedding for Retail POS (OPOS) driver to 
properly communicate with the software solution. Contact the hardware 
manufacturer to inquire about the availability of OPOS drivers for a specific 
type of peripheral.

Q: I have a PC that runs Microsoft Office and my accounting software. Can I 
use this computer, and does Microsoft Retail Management System work with my 
other software? 

A: Yes. Microsoft Retail Management System integrates with Microsoft Office 
and with various accounting applications at the summary general ledger level, 
including Microsoft Business Solutions accounting products (Microsoft Business 
Solutions?Great Plains, Microsoft Business Solutions Small Business Manager), 
QuickBooks, Peachtree, Blackbaud, and MYOB. For example, you will have the 
ability to export working reports into Microsoft Excel for further data 
analysis, or use Microsoft Word to do a mail merge of customer information 
stored in your new Microsoft Retail Management System database for targeted 
marketing campaigns.

Top of page 


Q: Can I buy and install Microsoft Retail Management System myself? 

A: No. Microsoft Retail Management System is not sold in retail stores, but is 
available from a wide network of Microsoft partners. Experienced Microsoft 
Certified Partners are retail and software experts who evaluate your business 
requirements, sell you the system, install it, and provide training and support.

 The POS Geeks ensure you get the system most suited to your business and that 
you maximize the return on your technology investment.

Q: How long will it take me to learn to use Microsoft Retail Management System 
and to teach my employees to use it? 

A: Based on reports from customers and Microsoft partners, it generally takes 
anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes to train cashiers and employees. If they need to 
learn all the features of the POS, it could take a day or two of working with 
the system to get a good feel for it. How quickly you and your employees learn 
Microsoft Retail Management System may also depend on what kind of POS system 
you previously had been using. For example, if you were using a manual cash 
register and paper ledgers, then it may take a little longer. The POS Geeks can 
walk you through the training, make it easy to understand, and be available for 
follow-up questions. Overall, managers and store owners will want to take 
advantage of the many rich features Microsoft Retail Management System 
provides. Partners say that a store can be up and running in a day.

Top of page 


Q: Can I customize the application? 

A: Yes. Microsoft Retail Management System has various integration options 
that allow third-party developers to enhance the provided features. It also 
allows for totally new, customized features to meet your unique needs. Many 
third-party applications exist that extend Microsoft Retail Management System 
to fit specific vertical markets.

Q: What types of reports are available within the application? 

A: Microsoft Retail Management System offers customizable reports, called 
Active Reports, that give users insight into their sales, customers, taxes, 
orders, and more. Active Reports can be filtered, grouped, and sorted by any 
field in the report window. Also, columns can be hidden or displayed to let 
users see only the data that matters to them. Reports can be exported to Excel, 
e-mail messages, HTML, XML, and other formats, too.

Top of page 


Q: What types of transactions can I perform at the POS? 

A: The POS application supports the following types of transactions: layaways, 
quotes, work orders, back orders, returns/voids, and regular sales.

Q: Can I use my current credit card processing system with Microsoft Retail 
Management System?  

A: Potentially. Microsoft Retail Management System offers integrated credit 
card processing imbedded directly into the application through an arrangement 
with Citi Merchant Services. The system also offers integration with other 
third parties, including PC Charge, IC Verify, and more.

Top of page 


Q: Can the system automatically create purchase orders? 

A: Microsoft Retail Management System can automatically create purchase orders 
at a user's request based on reorder information or sales history. Users can 
also build their own purchase orders for specific departments, categories, 
suppliers, and other purposes.

Q: Is there a limit to the number of items, customers, suppliers, and other 
data that I can input? 

A: Microsoft Retail Management System does not impose any limits on the number 
of items, customers, and other data entries. Provided there is enough disk 
space on the server, Microsoft Retail Management System can support an 
unlimited number of data entries.

Top of page 


Q: How is the software licensed? 

A: Microsoft Retail Management System is licensed by active POS registers. The 
back office application, Manager, is used to enter items, purchase orders, and 
other data, as well as run reports and view inventory. Therefore, if a client 
has five computers in a store, with only three being used as active POS 
registers, only three licenses are required.

Q: What type of security is offered in Microsoft Retail Management System? 

A: Microsoft Retail Management System offers extremely tight, flexible 
security within each product. Users have the ability to grant or deny access to 
any given menu option, window, button, or field within the applications. There 
are as many as 31 different levels of security that allow you to customize the 
security settings of your store. You have complete control over who has access 
to each kind of information.

Top of page 


Q: How soon will Microsoft Retail Management System pay for itself, and what 
is the ongoing value to my business? 

A: Many people who incorporate Microsoft Retail Management System into their 
business report a quick return on their initial investment. To find out what 
your return on investment could be, Contact Us 
 or speak to a customer service 
representative by using our Live Chat.

Q: What kind of inventory tracking does Microsoft Retail Management System 
feature? 

A: Among many other powerful features, Microsoft Retail Management System uses 
automated inventory tracking. You can simplify manual stock counts with 
automated inventory tracking across one or multiple locations, using any stock 
or sales method. You can support most compatible inventory types, including 
standard, serialized, kit, assembly, matrix, lot matrix, voucher, 
non-inventory, and weighed. You can also quickly and accurately calculate how 
much inventory you need to replenish, and you can track storage of offline 
inventory, such as non-sellable or broken items.

Top of page 


Q: Will my customers notice anything different at the register? 

A: Yes. Your customers will be impressed with the level of detail you'll now 
be able to provide them through Microsoft Retail Management System. They'll get 
immediate access to detailed product information, personalized information 
about their previous purchases and payments, and account information. With 
quick information about customers' buying histories at your fingertips, you'll 
be able to generate copies of old receipts and suggest relevant up-sells, sale 
items, and volume discounts. Plus, by providing all of your employees with 
standardized POS tools that offer the immediate access to detailed product 
information, you give your customers consistent and personalized information.

Q: I want to improve our store's marketing campaigns. Can Microsoft Retail 
Management System help? 

A: Yes. You can use Microsoft Retail Management System to create special 
promotions such as "Buy one, get one free" or "Buy two at the regular price and 
receive the next two at half off." Also, schedule store sales in advance for 
entire departments, categories, or supplier catalogs for a specified date or 
time. At the point of sale, you can track each discount given to customers 
through reason codes to gain insight into which sales and promotions are most 
successful. Use the data in the Microsoft Retail Management System SQL database 
to build a mail merge in Word or Excel for customer mailings and 
advertisements. Track your customers' purchase histories to learn their buying 
habits and to deliver personalized service that will keep them coming back for 
more.

 Every Windows product has a lifecycle. The lifecycle begins when a product 
is released and ends when it's no longer supported or sold. Knowing key dates 
in this lifecycle helps you make informed decisions about when to upgrade or 
make other changes to your software. Here are the rights and limits of the
Windows lifecycle. 

 End of sales

End of sales refers to the date when a particular version of Windows is no 
longer shipped to retailers or Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). 
Examples of OEMS are Dell and Toshiba—PC manufacturers who often preinstall
Windows software. When a version of Windows reaches its end of sales date, it's 
a good time to think about upgrading.

 This table gives end of sales dates for specific Windows operating systems.

 * Note that when the retail software product reaches its end of sales date, 
it can still be purchased through OEMs (the company that made your PC) until it 
reaches the end of sales date for PCs withWindows preinstalled. 

End of sales: questions and answers 

Show all  
 What is the 
lifecycle policy if I purchase a PC with Windows already installed? 


 When Microsoft launches a new version of Windows, we will continue to allow 
OEMs to sell PCs preinstalled with the previous version for up to two years 
after the launch date of the new version. Certain OEM versions ofWindows 
products include downgrade rights (as outlined within the software license 
terms). Downgrade rights make it possible to use a previous version ofWindows 
instead of the licensed software preinstalled on a new PC. SeeDowngrade rights 
 for additional details. 

  What is the 
lifecycle policy if I purchase Windows as a packaged product? 


 We will continue to allow retailers to sell the previous version of Windows 
for a year after the launch date of the new version.

  What is the 
lifecycle policy for versions of Windows purchased through Volume Licensing? 


 For Volume Licensing programs, licenses will continue to be available 
through downgrade rights after the end of general availability. General 
availability of licenses for the previous version ofWindows will cease as soon 
as the new version is available. However, we will make media available for the 
current version as well as the previous two versions.

  End of support 

End of support refers to the date when Microsoft no longer provides automatic 
fixes, updates, or online technical assistance. This is the time to make sure 
you have thelatest available service pack 
 installed. 
WithoutMicrosoft support, you will no longer receive security updates that can 
help protect your PC from harmful viruses, spyware, and other malicious 
software that can steal your personal information. For more information go to 
Microsoft Support Lifecycle .

End of support: questions and answers 

Show all  
 What is the 
difference between mainstream support and extended support? 



 * Mainstream support—Microsoft will offer mainstream support for a minimum of 
5 years from the date of a product's general availability, or for 2 years after 
the successor product is released, whichever is longer. For example, if you buy 
a new version ofWindows and five years later another version is released, you 
will still have two years of support left for the previous version.


 * Extended support—Microsoft will offer extended support for either a minimum 
of 5 years from the date of a product's general availability, or for 2 years 
after the second successor product (two versions later) is released, whichever 
is longer.

 For more details on the difference between mainstream support and extended 
support, refer to the Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ 
. 

  What should 
I do when the version of Windows I'm using reaches its end of support date? 


 You can either install the latest available service pack or upgrade to a 
newer version ofWindows. For more information, see What does it mean if my 
version ofWindows is no longer supported?

Windows products recently reached their end of support dates? 


 See  End of support for Windows XP with Service Pack 2 and Windows Vista

 for this 
information. These are the most recent versions ofWindows to be affected by end 
of support deadlines. To find the end of support dates for all versions of
Windows products, see Lifecycle Information for Windows Client Products

  Can I run 
my earlier Windows XP programs on Windows 8? 


Windows 8 is designed to be compatible with the most popular hardware and 
software products you use every day. Thousands of these will work just fine. The
Windows 8 Compatibility Center

 Service packs

 Service packs are part of the process of keeping your Windows product up to 
date. They combine the latest updates and fixes into one package or download. A 
service pack can include security and performance improvements as well as 
support for new types of hardware. To install the latest service pack of
Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7, visit the Service Pack Center 
.

Service packs: questions and answers 

Show all  
 What is the 
support policy for Windows service packs? 


 Support ends 24 months after the next service pack releases or at the end of 
the product's support lifecycle, whichever comes first. If you are using 
software without the latest service pack you won't be offered any new security 
or non-security updates, although preexisting updates will continue to be 
offered. Refer to theService Pack Lifecycle Support Policy 
 for further information. 

  If my 
version of Windows offers regular update notices, does that mean I have a 
service pack installed? 


 Not necessarily. Update notices only indicate your software has not reached 
its end of support date. To find out if you already have a service pack 
installed, read the information on ourWindows Update 
 page. To 
install the latestWindows service packs, see the Service Pack Center 
.

Answer:  

 Answer 

 A retail copy is one that you would buy in a typical store. It usually comes 
with technical documentation, has less restrictive licensing, and costs more. 
An OEM version costs less, has less documentation, and usually limits you in 
your ability to transfer the product from one computer to the other.

On how many computers can you install the retail version of Windows 8? 


up vote  2 down vote  favorite 

1 I bought the Windows 8 Pro retail install disc (not the upgrade). I seem to 
recall somewhere hearing that you can install it onto multiple computers 
without having to purchase a new license key. How many computers are you 
allowed to install it on, before purchasing a new key?

For instance, I'm debating whether to install Windows 8 onto my laptop as 
well as my desktop (on which it is already installed).

5,65931535 This is a valid issue, and you do mention Windows 8, but I think 
it's not on-topicfor this site. This isn't a technical/software question about 
an OS. It's a legal question about licensing. – Lord Torgamus 
 Nov 9 '12 at 19:52 See 
superuser.com/questions/494782/…

@LordTorgamus We generally don't do legal questions, but practical questions 
about Windows licensing have always been welcome AFAICT. – slhck?

On one.

Under our license, we grant you the right to install and run that one copy on 
one computer (the licensed computer) as the operating system on a computer that 
you build for your personal use

and also:

Anytime you transfer the software to a new computer, you must remove the 
software from the prior computer.

Refer to the Personal Use License 
.

Full Version Retail licensing does not exist anymore like it did for XP and 
W7, it is replaced by OEM "System Builder" with the "Personal Use Licence" 
clause, essentially the same thing.

See my post here

10.8k31850 Just a note that there are special keys that allow multiple 
activations. However, it will always be mentioned, and generally only applies 
to volume licence, MSDN subscriptions, etc.. Not something you would pick up at 
a local store. – Bob  Oct 31 '12 at 11:43
But is it enforced? What happens if I install my retail copy of windows 8 on 
multiple computers, will the first install stop working when I install the 
second? – bjarkef  Nov 29 '12 at 7:32 
@bjarkef No, but you are breaking the EULA and if Microsoft was so inclined 
they could sue you and legally they are in the right so you would have to pay 
the copyright infringement fees do to your unauthorized copying of the software 
on to two machines simultaneously. – Scott Chamberlain 
 Dec 10 '12 at 3:44 
@ScottChamberlain: Actually, I live in Denmark, some years ago there was a 
court case regarding this, but relating to Windows XP I think. The judge stated 
that the end-user (who where suing) could install Windows on as many of his 
computer as he wanted, as he was only a single person and could therefore only 
use one computer at a time. No matter what the EULA says. So as long as 
Microsoft have not put in any technical limits, I will not hesitate to install 
my Windows copy on multiple computers. :) – bjarkef 
 Dec 11 '12 at 10:24 @bjarkef There is 
no guarantee that Microsoft does not have a method to deactivate such 
installations - it's not exactly hard to detect. And one reason we don't do 
legal discussions here (for the most part) is due to country specific 
legislation and precedent - all we will/can say is you are violating the EULA. 
– Bob  Dec 11 '12 at 11:06   up vote 
4 down vote  The retail install disk only entitles you to a single installed 
instance of the software at any one time.

Unlike the OEM license which dies with the machine, you are allowed to 
reinstall on as many different machines as you want, as many times as you want 
- but, you must uninstall/delete it from any machine before you install it on 
the next.

 Login and Registration Issues

Why can’t I login? There are several reasons why this could occur. First, 
ensure your username and password are correct. If they are, contact the board 
owner to make sure you haven’t been banned. It is also possible the website 
owner has a configuration error on their end, and they would need to fix it. Top
  Why do I need to register 
at all? You may not have to, it is up to the administrator of the board as to 
whether you need to register in order to post messages. However; registration 
will give you access to additional features not available to guest users such 
as definable avatar images, private messaging, emailing of fellow users, 
usergroup subscription, etc. It only takes a few moments to register so it is 
recommended you do so. Top  
Why do I get logged off automatically? If you do not check the Log me in 
automatically box when you login, the board will only keep you logged in for a 
preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay 
logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access 
the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university 
computer lab, etc. If you do not see this checkbox, it means the board 
administrator has disabled this feature. Top 
 How do I prevent my username 
appearing in the online user listings? Within your User Control Panel, under 
“Board preferences”, you will find the optionHide your online status. Enable 
this option withYes and you will only appear to the administrators, moderators 
and yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user. Top 
 I’ve lost my password! Don’t 
panic! While your password cannot be retrieved, it can easily be reset. Visit 
the login page and clickI’ve forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and 
you should be able to log in again shortly. Top 
 I registered but cannot 
login! First, check your username and password. If they are correct, then one 
of two things may have happened. If COPPA support is enabled and you specified 
being under 13 years old during registration, you will have to follow the 
instructions you received. Some boards will also require new registrations to 
be activated, either by yourself or by an administrator before you can logon; 
this information was present during registration. If you were sent an e-mail, 
follow the instructions. If you did not receive an e-mail, you may have 
provided an incorrect e-mail address or the e-mail may have been picked up by a 
spam filer. If you are sure the e-mail address you provided is correct, try 
contacting an administrator. Top 
 I registered in the past but 
cannot login any more?! It is possible an administrator has deactivated or 
deleted your account for some reason. Also, many boards periodically remove 
users who have not posted for a long time to reduce the size of the database. 
If this has happened, try registering again and being more involved in 
discussions. Top  What is 
COPPA? COPPA, or the Child Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998, is a law 
in the United States requiring websites which can potentially collect 
information from minors under the age of 13 to have written parental consent or 
some other method of legal guardian acknowledgment, allowing the collection of 
personally identifiable information from a minor under the age of 13. If you 
are unsure if this applies to you as someone trying to register or to the 
website you are trying to register on, contact legal counsel for assistance. 
Please note that the phpBB Group cannot provide legal advice and is not a point 
of contact for legal concerns of any kind, except as outlined below. Top 
 Why can’t I register? It is 
possible the website owner has banned your IP address or disallowed the 
username you are attempting to register. The website owner could have also 
disabled registration to prevent new visitors from signing up. Contact a board 
administrator for assistance. Top 
 What does the “Delete all 
board cookies” do? “Delete all board cookies” deletes the cookies created by 
phpBB which keep you authenticated and logged into the board. It also provides 
functions such as read tracking if they have been enabled by the board owner. 
If you are having login or logout problems, deleting board cookies may help. Top
  User Preferences and 
settings

How do I change my settings? If you are a registered user, all your settings 
are stored in the board database. To alter them, visit your User Control Panel; 
a link can usually be found at the top of board pages. This system will allow 
you to change all your settings and preferences. Top 
 The times are not correct! 
It is possible the time displayed is from a timezone different from the one you 
are in. If this is the case, visit your User Control Panel and change your 
timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, 
etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be 
done by registered users. If you are not registered, this is a good time to do 
so. Top  I changed the 
timezone and the time is still wrong! If you are sure you have set the timezone 
and Summer Time/DST correctly and the time is still incorrect, then the time 
stored on the server clock is incorrect. Please notify an administrator to 
correct the problem. Top  My 
language is not in the list! Either the administrator has not installed your 
language or nobody has translated this board into your language. Try asking the 
board administrator if they can install the language pack you need. If the 
language pack does not exist, feel free to create a new translation. More 
information can be found at the phpBB website (see link at the bottom of board 
pages). Top  How do I show an 
image along with my username? There are two images which may appear along with 
a username when viewing posts. One of them may be an image associated with your 
rank, generally in the form of stars, blocks or dots, indicating how many posts 
you have made or your status on the board. Another, usually a larger image, is 
known as an avatar and is generally unique or personal to each user. It is up 
to the board administrator to enable avatars and to choose the way in which 
avatars can be made available. If you are unable to use avatars, contact a 
board administrator and ask them for their reasons. Top 
 What is my rank and how do I 
change it? Ranks, which appear below your username, indicate the number of 
posts you have made or identify certain users, e.g. moderators and 
administrators. In general, you cannot directly change the wording of any board 
ranks as they are set by the board administrator. Please do not abuse the board 
by posting unnecessarily just to increase your rank. Most boards will not 
tolerate this and the moderator or administrator will simply lower your post 
count. Top  When I click the 
e-mail link for a user it asks me to login? Only registered users can send 
e-mail to other users via the built-in e-mail form, and only if the 
administrator has enabled this feature. This is to prevent malicious use of the 
e-mail system by anonymous users. Top 
 Posting Issues

How do I post a topic in a forum? To post a new topic in a forum, click the 
relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register 
before you can post a message. A list of your permissions in each forum is 
available at the bottom of the forum and topic screens. Example: You can post 
new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. Top 
 How do I edit or delete a 
post? Unless you are a board administrator or moderator, you can only edit or 
delete your own posts. You can edit a post by clicking the edit button for the 
relevant post, sometimes for only a limited time after the post was made. If 
someone has already replied to the post, you will find a small piece of text 
output below the post when you return to the topic which lists the number of 
times you edited it along with the date and time. This will only appear if 
someone has made a reply; it will not appear if a moderator or administrator 
edited the post, though they may leave a note as to why they’ve edited the post 
at their own discretion. Please note that normal users cannot delete a post 
once someone has replied. Top 
How do I add a signature to my post? To add a signature to a post you must 
first create one via your User Control Panel. Once created, you can check the
Attach a signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also 
add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio 
button in your profile. If you do so, you can still prevent a signature being 
added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box within the 
posting form. Top  How do I 
create a poll? When posting a new topic or editing the first post of a topic, 
click the “Poll creation” tab below the main posting form; if you cannot see 
this, you do not have appropriate permissions to create polls. Enter a title 
and at least two options in the appropriate fields, making sure each option is 
on a separate line in the textarea. You can also set the number of options 
users may select during voting under “Options per user”, a time limit in days 
for the poll (0 for infinite duration) and lastly the option to allow users to 
amend their votes. Top  Why 
can’t I add more poll options? The limit for poll options is set by the board 
administrator. If you feel you need to add more options to your poll than the 
allowed amount, contact the board administrator. Top 
 How do I edit or delete a 
poll? As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a 
moderator or an administrator. To edit a poll, click to edit the first post in 
the topic; this always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a 
vote, users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if members 
have already placed votes, only moderators or administrators can edit or delete 
it. This prevents the poll’s options from being changed mid-way through a poll. 
Top  Why can’t I access a 
forum? Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, 
post or perform another action you may need special permissions. Contact a 
moderator or board administrator to grant you access. Top 
 Why can’t I add attachments? 
Attachment permissions are granted on a per forum, per group, or per user 
basis. The board administrator may not have allowed attachments to be added for 
the specific forum you are posting in, or perhaps only certain groups can post 
attachments. Contact the board administrator if you are unsure about why you 
are unable to add attachments. Top 
 Why did I receive a warning? 
Each board administrator has their own set of rules for their site. If you have 
broken a rule, you may be issued a warning. Please note that this is the board 
administrator’s decision, and the phpBB Group has nothing to do with the 
warnings on the given site. Contact the board administrator if you are unsure 
about why you were issued a warning. Top 
 How can I report posts to a 
moderator? If the board administrator has allowed it, you should see a button 
for reporting posts next to the post you wish to report. Clicking this will 
walk you through the steps necessary to report the post. Top 
 What is the “Save” button 
for in topic posting? This allows you to save passages to be completed and 
submitted at a later date. To reload a saved passage, visit the User Control 
Panel. Top  Why does my post 
need to be approved? The board administrator may have decided that posts in the 
forum you are posting to require review before submission. It is also possible 
that the administrator has placed you in a group of users whose posts require 
review before submission. Please contact the board administrator for further 
details. Top  How do I bump 
my topic? By clicking the “Bump topic” link when you are viewing it, you can 
“bump” the topic to the top of the forum on the first page. However, if you do 
not see this, then topic bumping may be disabled or the time allowance between 
bumps has not yet been reached. It is also possible to bump the topic simply by 
replying to it, however, be sure to follow the board rules when doing so. Top 
 Formatting and Topic Types

What is BBCode? BBCode is a special implementation of HTML, offering great 
formatting control on particular objects in a post. The use of BBCode is 
granted by the administrator, but it can also be disabled on a per post basis 
from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML, but tags are 
enclosed in square brackets [ and ] rather than . For more information 
on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page. Top 
 Can I use HTML? No. It is 
not possible to post HTML on this board and have it rendered as HTML. Most 
formatting which can be carried out using HTML can be applied using BBCode 
instead. Top  What are 
Smilies? Smilies, or Emoticons, are small images which can be used to express a 
feeling using a short code, e.g. :) denotes happy, while :( denotes sad. The 
full list of emoticons can be seen in the posting form. Try not to overuse 
smilies, however, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator 
may edit them out or remove the post altogether. The board administrator may 
also have set a limit to the number of smilies you may use within a post. Top 
 Can I post images? Yes, 
images can be shown in your posts. If the administrator has allowed 
attachments, you may be able to upload the image to the board. Otherwise, you 
must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. 
http://www.example.com/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on 
your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor images stored 
behind authentication mechanisms, e.g. hotmail or yahoo mailboxes, password 
protected sites, etc. To display the image use the BBCode [img] tag. Top 
 What are global 
announcements? Global announcements contain important information and you 
should read them whenever possible. They will appear at the top of every forum 
and within your User Control Panel. Global announcement permissions are granted 
by the board administrator. Top 
 What are announcements? 
Announcements often contain important information for the forum you are 
currently reading and you should read them whenever possible. Announcements 
appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. As with 
global announcements, announcement permissions are granted by the board 
administrator. Top  What are 
sticky topics? Sticky topics within the forum appear below announcements and 
only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them 
whenever possible. As with announcements and global announcements, sticky topic 
permissions are granted by the board administrator. Top 
 What are locked topics? 
Locked topics are topics where users can no longer reply and any poll it 
contained was automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons and 
were set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You may 
also be able to lock your own topics depending on the permissions you are 
granted by the board administrator. Top 
 What are topic icons? Topic 
icons are author chosen images associated with posts to indicate their content. 
The ability to use topic icons depends on the permissions set by the board 
administrator. Top  User 
Levels and Groups

What are Administrators? Administrators are members assigned with the highest 
level of control over the entire board. These members can control all facets of 
board operation, including setting permissions, banning users, creating 
usergroups or moderators, etc., dependent upon the board founder and what 
permissions he or she has given the other administrators. They may also have 
full moderator capabilities in all forums, depending on the settings put forth 
by the board founder. Top  
What are Moderators? Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) who 
look after the forums from day to day. They have the authority to edit or 
delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they 
moderate. Generally, moderators are present to prevent users from going 
off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material. Top 
 What are usergroups? 
Usergroups are groups of users that divide the community into manageable 
sections board administrators can work with. Each user can belong to several 
groups and each group can be assigned individual permissions. This provides an 
easy way for administrators to change permissions for many users at once, such 
as changing moderator permissions or granting users access to a private forum. 
Top  Where are the usergroups 
and how do I join one? You can view all usergroups via the “Usergroups” link 
within your User Control Panel. If you would like to join one, proceed by 
clicking the appropriate button. Not all groups have open access, however. Some 
may require approval to join, some may be closed and some may even have hidden 
memberships. If the group is open, you can join it by clicking the appropriate 
button. If a group requires approval to join you may request to join by 
clicking the appropriate button. The user group leader will need to approve 
your request and may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not harass a 
group leader if they reject your request; they will have their reasons. Top 
 How do I become a usergroup 
leader? A usergroup leader is usually assigned when usergroups are initially 
created by a board administrator. If you are interested in creating a 
usergroup, your first point of contact should be an administrator; try sending 
a private message. Top  Why 
do some usergroups appear in a different colour? It is possible for the board 
administrator to assign a colour to the members of a usergroup to make it easy 
to identify the members of this group. Top 
 What is a “Default 
usergroup”? If you are a member of more than one usergroup, your default is 
used to determine which group colour and group rank should be shown for you by 
default. The board administrator may grant you permission to change your 
default usergroup via your User Control Panel. Top 
 What is “The team” link? 
This page provides you with a list of board staff, including board 
administrators and moderators and other details such as the forums they 
moderate. Top  Private 
Messaging

I cannot send private messages! There are three reasons for this; you are not 
registered and/or not logged on, the board administrator has disabled private 
messaging for the entire board, or the board administrator has prevented you 
from sending messages. Contact a board administrator for more information. Top 
 I keep getting unwanted 
private messages! You can block a user from sending you private messages by 
using message rules within your User Control Panel. If you are receiving 
abusive private messages from a particular user, inform a board administrator; 
they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages. Top 
 I have received a spamming 
or abusive e-mail from someone on this board! We are sorry to hear that. The 
e-mail form feature of this board includes safeguards to try and track users 
who send such posts, so e-mail the board administrator with a full copy of the 
e-mail you received. It is very important that this includes the headers that 
contain the details of the user that sent the e-mail. The board administrator 
can then take action. Top  
Friends and Foes

What are my Friends and Foes lists? You can use these lists to organise other 
members of the board. Members added to your friends list will be listed within 
your User Control Panel for quick access to see their online status and to send 
them private messages. Subject to template support, posts from these users may 
also be highlighted. If you add a user to your foes list, any posts they make 
will be hidden by default. Top 
 How can I add / remove users 
to my Friends or Foes list? You can add users to your list in two ways. Within 
each user’s profile, there is a link to add them to either your Friend or Foe 
list. Alternatively, from your User Control Panel, you can directly add users 
by entering their member name. You may also remove users from your list using 
the same page. Top  Searching 
the Forums

How can I search a forum or forums? Enter a search term in the search box 
located on the index, forum or topic pages. Advanced search can be accessed by 
clicking the “Advance Search” link which is available on all pages on the 
forum. How to access the search may depend on the style used. Top 
 Why does my search return no 
results? Your search was probably too vague and included many common terms 
which are not indexed by phpBB3. Be more specific and use the options available 
within Advanced search. Top  
Why does my search return a blank page!? Your search returned too many results 
for the webserver to handle. Use “Advanced search” and be more specific in the 
terms used and forums that are to be searched. Top 
 How do I search for members? 
Visit to the “Members” page and click the “Find a member” link. Top 
 How can I find my own posts 
and topics? Your own posts can be retrieved either by clicking the “Search 
user’s posts” within the User Control Panel or via your own profile page. To 
search for your topics, use the Advanced search page and fill in the various 
options appropriately. Top  
Topic Subscriptions and Bookmarks

What is the difference between bookmarking and subscribing? Bookmarking in 
phpBB3 is much like bookmarking in your web browser. You aren’t alerted when 
there’s an update, but you can come back to the topic later. Subscribing, 
however, will notify you when there is an update to the topic or forum on the 
board via your preferred method or methods. Top 
 How do I subscribe to 
specific forums or topics? To subscribe to a specific forum, click the 
“Subscribe forum” link upon entering the forum. To subscribe to a topic, reply 
to the topic with the subscribe checkbox checked or click the “Subscribe topic” 
link within the topic itself. Top 
 How do I remove my 
subscriptions? To remove your subscriptions, go to your User Control Panel and 
follow the links to your subscriptions. Top 
 Attachments

What attachments are allowed on this board? Each board administrator can 
allow or disallow certain attachment types. If you are unsure what is allowed 
to be uploaded, contact the board administrator for assistance. Top 
 How do I find all my 
attachments? To find your list of attachments that you have uploaded, go to 
your User Control Panel and follow the links to the attachments section. Top

Choosing A Retail Computer System

Your choice in a retail point of sale system is vital to the success and 
stability of your business. It is the hub around which everything revolves. You 
should have confidence in – and receive performance from – the system that is 
ultimately responsible for customer transactions, inventory management and 
every other action in your supply chain and tracking.



Let's walk through some important questions you should ask yourself when 
choosing a Retail System:

What Type Of Business Are You?

POS Systems are typically grouped in 2 separate categories: 
Restaurant/Hospitality and Retail. Restaurants are somewhat of a different 
breed – the focus of this article is Retail POS Systems.

Within the retail sector, pricing on Point Of Sale Systems can range from a 
couple hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. There are POS systems 
customized for every type of business under the sun, fromGift Shops 
 and Mall Kiosks 
 to Pet Stores 
 and Bike Shops 
.

Custom features are great BUT, the most important feature of your retail 
system is that it's easy to use. What good is a feature if it's too hard to use 
or buried among so many other features that you can't find it? Business owners 
are opting for simple, streamlined retail POS systems that focus on 
fundamentals and deliver them flawlessly. This is why so many entrepreneurs are 
turning toweb based point of sale systems 
 to fulfill their 
retail computer needs.

What POS Computers & Software Are Best For Me?

Do you prefer Windows? Mac OS X 
? Perhaps 
Linux? You can find great POS Systems that are equally powerful on any of these 
platforms, so choose the platform with which you're already the most 
comfortable.

In the past, POS systems were typically installed on business computers as 
software packages, much like Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint come packaged 
on Windows computers. Unfortunately, software based POS Systems present many 
problems and vulnerabilities that small and medium sized business have found 
overwhelming.

What about software updates? What if my computer breaks? How do I backup and 
save all my data? What if the platform needs patches or problems are found in 
the operating system or software?

These are questions you shouldn't have to deal with as a business owner — 
after all, why invest in a POS System that creates even more questions and 
uncertainties? Web based retail systems are solving these problems for many 
small retailers.

Advantages of Web Based Retail Systems


 * Software features and improvements are continually added and updated 
automatically. You never deal with software updates, downloads and changes. 
Someone else takes care of it for you. 
 * Because the solution is web based, you can access your inventory from any 
internet enabled computer in the world. A computer breaking becomes an 
incredibly minor problem. 
 * What happens if your computer crashes and it cannot be fixed? With a web 
based POS your information is continuously saved to a remote location that can 
be recovered even if your actual computer cannot be. Do You Have a Dedicated 
Retail IT Department?

Probably not! What small business can afford dedicating employees solely to 
managing their computers?

When something goes wrong with your system, how long can you afford for your 
business to be “down”? How long will it take to explain your problem via 
telephone or e-mail and to be walked through the steps? How long will it take 
for an IT professional to arrive to fix your POS System?

That's one of the beauties of a web based point of sale – experts can log 
into your system and fix the problem for you. This alleviates many of the 
support problems inherent of typical desktop software-based point of sale 
systems.

POS Bundles or Mix and Match?

If you're a brand new business or implementing a POS System for the first 
time, you can buy a package that will include every component needed to get up 
and running immediately… from your computer to your barcode scanners and 
receipt printer. You can realize great discounts for buying an all-inclusive 
bundle and for many entrepreneurs, this is the best idea.

Other companies may have existing hardware they'd like to use with their new 
system. Or, they may be cost conscious companies looking to achieve 
affordability through the purchase of refurbished hardware and use of existing 
hardware.

So What's The Bottom Line?

While companies seeking POS Systems are typically looking for customized 
hardware and traditional software bundles, small and medium sized businesses 
“in the know” prefer web based POS solutions for their flexibility, 
affordability and overall ability to deliver great results with premium service.

holistic, integrated system.

As furniture software specialists, we understand your relevant issues; our 
software was created from the ground up as a Windows-based business tool for

 Eclicktic allows you to test marketing and sales programs and track the 
results

How many times have you been frustrated by trying to figure out which 
marketing programs are working and which ones aren’t? With Eclicktic, you can 
finally track the results. There is a MYRIAD of ways to have Eclicktic put you 
on the right marketing track.


 * Tracking Sales Incentive Programs: If your sales team isn’t upselling the 
number of fabric or case good warranties that you’d like, try a special 
incentive program. Track a 2-week sales promotion and see the results.
 * Merchandising: For a 2-week period, test different locations for key 
merchandise. See if moving the first display to the right of the entryway 
delivers an expected sales bump. Adjust “hot zones” in your store to maximize 
profits.
 * Source of Leads: Test a new local direct mail program. Ask each and every 
visitor how they heard about you. Tally the results to make an informed 
decision.
 * Percentage of Browsers Converted Into Buyers: With Eclicktic, analyze your 
current conversion rate. Set a goal that is increased by 10% and see if higher 
expectations lead to better results.  Eclicktic gives you actionable results

What is the purpose of data if it can’t move your business ahead? With 
Eclicktic, you get answers that can help you make better buying, hiring, and 
logistical decisions.

 RetailSTAR POS Software

7 Reviews  
(3.2/5)  RetailSTAR POS by CAM Commerce has been an industry leader for 
specialty retail shops for more than 25 years.

 CAM Commerce serves more than 20,000 retailers across various markets. The 
company is one of the biggest names in retail software. RetailSTAR is targeted 
at small to mid-sized retailers with up to $100 million in annual revenue. 
Clothing stores, sporting goods retailers, gift and hobby shops, and health 
food stores are some of RetailSTAR's best segment fits.

 RetailSTAR offers a full suite of applications. We are big fans of 
RetailSTAR's simple POS interface. The single-key or touch-screen input methods 
are easy for cashiers to use, even with limited computer experience. A CRM 
module can track purchasing history, customer comments, or anniversary 
notifications to improve your customer service. Other applications include 
inventory management, retail accounting, e-commerce, merchandise planning, 
warehouse management and supply chain management.

 Recently, RetailSTAR added mobile inventory applications. Their physical 
inventory app is especially helpful because it allows you to add and track 
inventory from your iPodTouch or iPhone 4 without an internet connection.

 We think RetailSTAR's robust customer support is one of the key 
differentiators this system has to offer. A North America-based customer 
service team offers real-time support. On-site or online software training is 
also available.

 RetailSTAR is an on-premise software solution built on C++ and Microsoft 
.Net, and is compatible with Windows servers. Retailers looking for a complete 
software and hardware solution can purchase HP POS terminals pre-installed with 
RetailSTAR directly through CAM Commerce.

Overall ratingReview by Jay from J's Tacker Shop | December 2012Ease-of-use
FunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportI am shocked those complaining and 
providing low marks on their reviews of this software and it's company the way 
they have. You received free software and now you are complaining that you have 
to pay at some point to continue and grow.

 I've looked, researched and priced them and their competitors. They are not 
only reasonable, but lower in most areas. I am very proficient at IT work and 
do much of it for my Retail Store, yet I paid to have my systems professionally 
installed and have that peace of mind because this is my business. They offer 
Training and Installation onsite as well as over the phone, you can save some 
money by doing it via the phone.

 They are after all, a business of their own. It boils down to this - this is 
how I make my money and pay my bills. It's not a hobby, it's my business, 
cutting corners is usually and most often not a good idea.

 This company that has bent over backwards to help me and this past Christmas 
was no exception. When one of my systems died, they were on the phone with us 
resolving it as best and as quickly as possible. It's not their fault I have 
been running that specific system for the past 5 years without ever cleaning it 
or updating it, it's hardware - it doesn't last forever. In fact 5 years, it 
paid for itself and ten-fold.

 I swim in the smaller pond, CAM has enabled me to swim well. The fact is, it 
takes money to make money, it costs to run a Retail Store, and in order to be 
successful at anything you have to invest time, effort and money.

 Take care of the store, it’s equipment, and work with their support people to 
get resolutions to the problems. No software is perfect and without bugs. 
Invest the time to learn it so you can effectively use it.

 I’ve had other POS from other companies and trust me, I’ve never had a better 
experience than I have running my POS from CAM Commerce. Their people have 
shown me time and time again that they actually care and do their best to 
overcome anything and everything.

Overall ratingReview by Chris  from Ziibwing | November 2012Ease-of-use
FunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportI made the mistake of purchasing 
CAM software for the gift shops I oversee. Unfortunately because of the size of 
the business and the website component we have been forced to continue with 
this system. CAM has not only been the worst company regarding customer service 
and fees, but in addition, there software has so many problems that it is a 
daily task to try and keep this system running. Thanks god I have the help of 
2-3 highly trained IT people that work for this organization in other areas who 
have been able to help. However, every time there is an upgrade to fix all of 
the current problems more problems are created. Countless error reports, Error 
messages, Random shut downs, Polling/communications issues leading to 
additional incorrect reports.
Response by Sherrie from CAM Commerce Solutions | January 2013I am extremely 
sorry to see that Chris has had such a negative experience with our company. In 
addition to restoring our partnership with Chris, our staff is working very 
hard to provide Ziibiwing with the very best software and support possible. We 
would not be in business if it weren’t for satisfied retailers finding success 
with our products and services. We are looking forward to helping Ziibiwing 
find that success.Overall ratingReview by Mihir from Touchdown | November 2012
Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportI have a sports apparel 
store and when I opened back in '04, I picked up their Retail ICE sw for free, 
this worked fine for three years with limited capabilities and since I was new 
and not really running reports, this did the job for ringing people up and 
basic inventory. Then came the time to network on two computers so naturally I 
signed up for their Retail STAR licensed version and forked over $2700.

 Again not running reports and just ringing people up continued for another 
few years. Trouble started when I went off-support at the end of the year after 
the upgrade, the smallest problem would be completely catastrophic and believe 
me there were quite a few of those.

 I endured this for a couple of years, paying $100 here a $150 there as and 
when stuff kept going wrong, having really got tired of this and needing to 
upgrade another of their super-duper shiny new now-everything-fixed versions, I 
forked over another $1800 for this so I get the upgrade and a yearlong support 
contract. This version was so badly bug-ridden that I was on the phone at least 
once a week for weeks on end. A few weeks before the end of my contract, I made 
sure I got another one of their now everything-fixed upgrades and still having 
problems related to the purchasing function, networking, data integrity etc. 
etc.
Overall ratingReview by Ron from JMR Associates, Inc./Just Casual/Urban City | 
March 2012Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportWe have young 
men's clothing stores located in North and South Carolina. We were looking for 
a POS system that would save us time and money and keep track of our inventory. 
We researched five different POS solutions and decided 6 years ago Retail STAR 
from CAM was the best choice.

 Retail STAR offers us all the features we need to run our stores efficiently. 
Our installation was quick and efficient and the system was easy to use. Making 
the day to day tasks simple for my staff.

 Since implementing Retail STAR, we are able to manage our inventory! We make 
better buying decisions, are able to act faster on best selling items, and 
markdown quickly on slow sellers. In today's market this system has saved us a 
lot of money ~ we are able to see our inventory levels and make better business 
decisions!
Overall ratingReview by Mellanie from I Thought About You | February 2012
Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportI began working for I 
Thought About You in early 2008. I was told that I would have to learn the new 
POS System the owner had purchased for the store. I panicked, as I was not 
familiar with anything like that. The CAM Installer/Trainer came on site and 
after 30 minutes we all were so familiar with the software that we could ring 
in our own sales without any assistance. It was so easy to learn, and I really 
liked that you didn’t have to use a mouse to complete a sale.

 We also had the Gift Cards and Frequent Buyer features, which we loved. I 
especially liked the integrated credit card processing because we didn’t have 
to do anything other than swipe the customer card through our monitor. 
Everything else just happened on its own. The best thing was that we never had 
issues where we’d have to call a technical support person. All the other 
companies we dealt with would put you on hold for so long, but not CAM. The 
couple of times I needed them, a technical support person picked up on my 1st 
call. I would highly recommend Retail STAR software to any retail business.

Overall ratingReview by Robert from HARRIS & FRANK | February 2012Ease-of-use
FunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportHARRIS & FRANK has been a customer 
of CAM's for 20 years. Great company, Great support. We began with their 
product Profits and used it for 14 years. We upgraded to Retail Star and their 
integrated Credit Card Processing 6 years ago. We were all hesitant about going 
to a new product because we aren’t very good with computers and it’s hard to 
“teach an old dog new tricks”!!

 We LOVE Retail Star. It’s so easy to operate, handles our inventory 
beautifully, and as a Buyer I really get a lot of use out of Report Star. I can 
use the existing reports or create my own with ease. As a fashion store the 
inventory can be cumbersome. I can buy a style in 14 colors and 10 sizes and 
Retail Star handles it with ease.

 I recommend it highly, regardless of the kind of store you are or the 
merchandise you carry.Overall ratingReview by Jim from Pequannock Feed & Pet 
Supply | November 2011Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportWe 
are a retail pet supply store. We have spent a year implementing Retail Star 
and we are still trying to learn how to use it. We have been paying $200 a 
month for tech support since last year. Unfortunately, a lot of our problems 
involve training, which is very expensive. I would think that the high price of 
this package would include enough training to do simple tasks. Receiving an 
order from a supplier is a good 2-hour ordeal, and we then have to spend more 
time to look up each item to see if the margin has changed.

 They have screen after screen of unwanted information. If I want to look at 
an item, see what it cost, the price and margin, what I last paid, when my last 
purchases were, and how many I have sold and to whom, it takes a lot of time, 
many screens and custom reports. My old system could do that in three clicks! I 
can't see what I owe my vendors or what my customers owe me because I haven't 
bought the A/P and A/R modules yet! We have been on tech support lately to find 
out why some of the simple transactions are giving us bad numbers. They are 
working on it.

 We were told that our data could be transferred over to the new system (extra 
$), but then it couldn't. We had to manually enter our 17,000 inventory items, 
customers, vendors, etc. Retail Star assigns its own bar codes, so the actual 
bar code on the product has to be put in as an alias, as does the vendors part 
number. I am sorry that so far I can't find anything about this system that 
makes life faster or easier. Do you use RetailSTAR?

Maintenance Tips 
Backup Reminder:
 It is important that you back up every night and make sure that your back up 
is working and that you know how to restore. Who is in charge of your backups?

Regular File Reconstruction and maintenance
 It is recommended that you make automated file reconstruction a routine part 
of your Retail Pro database management. File reconstruction can be performed 
automatically using the Retail Pro Scheduler. (Refer to Retail Pro Tool 
Supplement #8: The Scheduler.) You can schedule reconstruction of individual 
files or a group of files specified by a file list. You can create an unlimited 
number of file lists, each one including different files and each one scheduled 
to be run at a different time. Another recommended strategy for routine file 
maintenance is to periodically test all files and reconstruct those in which 
the program found errors. This is easily accomplished by selecting all files 
(or using a file list) and processing them in Test Data Only mode. Afterwards, 
only those files in which the program found errors will remain in the Selected 
Files list. Change the mode to Full Reconstruct and select Start to reprocess 
those remaining files.

System Diagnostic Tool
 The Retail Pro™ System Diagnostics Tool is used to diagnose and troubleshoot 
system and software problems. You can quickly and easily generate a diagnostic 
report containing a detailed analysis of system hardware, RTI software, and 
configuration settings. If necessary, the report can be printed and sent to 
Technical Support to aid in the identification and correction of a problem. 
Reports can be saved, printed, and optionally polled to the Main station.

Trouble with polling?
 Look at your polling logs and understand what they are telling you. Verify 
that polling between the stores is successful and correct any problems that 
could prevent a proper polling cycle. Verify that all transactions made at the 
remotes were properly polled to the main and processed. If you are consistent 
about checking your polling logs and acting on the messages in the logs then 
your polling issues will be minimal. A number of problems can be caused by 
over-sized or corrupt polling logs. If you start to have issues because you 
haven't been able to check your logs for a while and they become corrupt you 
can delete the logs; In the Rpro folder delete:
 Log.dat
 Log.dia
 Log.ix
 Logcount.dat
 Logcount.dia
 These files can be deleted at the Main and/or remote that is having the issue.



 For detailed information on polling, Version 8 customers should click the 
E-manuals shortcut from the opening screen in Retail Pro and then click on 
Supplemental Documentation. You can also click on the Version 8 user guide and 
browse to the polling section (Chapter 15).

 Version 7 customers also have E-manuals and some of you have the entire 
manual printed out. You will need to browse through Windows Explorer to your 
Rpro folder and then to the Manuals folder - if it is not there then it will be 
on your Version 7 Rpro CD.

 Equipment Maintenance
1. Never turn your computer off with the power switch until Windows has shut 
down.
 The one exception to this rule is when your computer locks up and your hard 
drive is not running (hard drive light is not blinking). In this situation, you 
can turn the power off without harmful effects to the hard drive. As cutting 
the power can also result in lost data or Windows files, you should only do 
this when you have to.

2. You should have a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) for your computer. A 
UPS with line conditioner is preferred. This will keep your computer from 
crashing during power outages, and will protect your computer from low and high 
voltage occurrences. An UPS is far superior to a surge protector and will save 
your computer from almost any power type of disaster.

3. Backup any data you cannot afford to lose to at least two separate 
physical drives. The time to backup is when you create something you can't 
afford to lose. Backups should be scheduled daily.

4. Defragment your hard drives at least once a month. This will keep your 
hard drive healthy and prevent crashes. It will also help with speed.

5. Never unplug peripherals from the computer when it is powered up. 
Unplugging with the power on can short out the connector socket or the 
motherboard.

The only exception to this rule is if you know a peripheral is "hot 
pluggable". If you do not know what "hot pluggable" means then ignore this 
exception. 

6. Do keep plenty of disk space available on your C: drive free for Windows 
to use. If you do not have enough free space you will choke Windows and it will 
start dumping data to your hard drive, or it will just get really, really, 
slow. Use the ADD/Delete tool in the Windows Control Panel to delete unneeded 
programs from your drive.

7. Do not let a lot of programs load up when you start your computer. They 
use valuable memory and Windows Resources (Windows internal workspace). All 
programs in your Windows System Tray (in the lower right of your screen) are 
running on your computer. Close them if you don't need them or run them and 
configure them not to load when you boot up.

8. Do use a virus checker regularly. Everyone should use a virus checker. The 
best type of protection is continuous monitoring from a dedicated anti-virus 
program like Trend Micro or McAfee. We have had significant speed issues when 
using Norton Antivirus with Retail Pro.

9. If you have a high speed Internet connection you need a firewall. A 
firewall program keeps those who want to hijack your computer from gaining 
access to your system. You really do not want someone else running your 
computer.

10. The greatest enemy to your computer is heat. It causes the internal 
components and chips to wear out. Heat also lowers the performance of your 
system. The first thing to check is the ventilation around your system. Many of 
the standard computer desks force you to place your computer in an enclosed 
cabinet. If your system is in an enclosed space, cut a hole in the back of the 
cabinet behind your cooling fan. This will allow it to draw cool air into the 
system. Your system should have at least 4 inches of space to the rear, with no 
clutter, loose paper, etc., to block the flow of air into the computer.

The second thing you can do, is to clean the dust from the inside surfaces of 
your system. Do this at least twice a year and your monitor once every 2 years.

Make sure that you clean the blades of the cooling fans. Clean the power 
supply fan, the CPU's cooling fan and the case fan (if you have one) as well.

Pro Tip: Keeping Your Inventory Compact
 As time passes, you should delete old merchandise that you no longer stock. 
However, this typically creates blank sections scattered throughout the 
inventory file. The empty rows will unnecessarily slow some inventory searches 
and analyses, as Retail Pro must read every row, empty or not. It is a good 
practice to fill in these gaps when adding new items. To locate an empty row, 
Clicknew from the first row of inventory and cursor will move to the first 
available empty record.

Diagnostic tool
 The Retail Pro System Diagnostics Tool is used to diagnose and troubleshoot 
system and software problems. You can quickly and easily generate a diagnostic 
report containing a detailed analysis of system hardware, RTI software, and 
configuration settings. If necessary, the report can be printed and sent to 
Technical Support to aid in the identification and correction of a problem. 
Reports can be saved, printed, and optionally polled to the Main station.
Step 1 From the TOOLS menu select DIAGNOSIS.
Step 2 In the Systems Diagnostics window, select the system components you 
want to include in the report. By default, all components are included except 
HARD DRIVE CONTENTS. To add a component, select its check box. To remove one, 
clear the check box.
Step 3 Select START to run the report immediately. The time required to 
complete the diagnosis will vary depending on the components selected and your 
system performance.
Step 4 After the diagnosis is completed, the report is displayed in the report 
window. Navigate through the report using the scroll bars, arrow keys, /, or 
the drop-down list of report areas. Selecting an area from the drop-down list 
takes you instantly to that section of the report.



 The first section of the report always includes date/time, 
store/station/workstation identification, and Retail Pro configuration 
information. This section is automatically included, so no option to 
include/exclude is available.

Data Maintenance 
 One recommended strategy for routine file maintenance is to periodically test 
all files and reconstruct those in which the program found errors. This is 
easily accomplished by selecting all files and processing them in Test Data 
Only mode. Afterwards, only those files in which the program found errors will 
remain in the Selected Files list. Change the mode to Full Reconstruct and 
select Start to reprocess those remaining files.

Faster Startup
 If you do not require the use of languages in Retail Pro other than the 
native English, you can disable loading of translation files during startup. 
You can also disable the display of the splash screen during startup. This can 
result in Retail Pro starting significantly faster in some cases (other program 
features and network configuration may also affect startup time). See the 
preference note below for more information.

Trainer Tips 
 Always check your system date when you sign on so all of your documents are 
dated correctly.

Would you like to set up a workstation to launch a specific document or 
chapter of a document when you select the E-manuals button?
 By default the E-manuals button launches the e-manuals home page. You can 
configure your system to directly display a specific document or chapter from 
within the User's Guide when the button is selected. For example, at a POS 
workstation you might want the button to display the Recording Sales and 
Returns chapter instead of the E-manuals home page. At a receiving station you 
could display the Receiving chapter and so on.



 1. Access Workstation Preferences > System > E-Manuals URL at the workstation
 2. Select the Browse button and navigate to the folder containing the 
E-manuals documents (by default this is the \Emanuals\Docs folder on the same 
hard drive as the program files).
 3. Locate and select the V8_10_Record_Sales.pdf file in the Select File 
dialog. Select Open to return this file to the E-manuals URL preference field.
 4. Select Save on the side toolbar.
 5. Return to the main retail pro menu and select the E-manuals button. The 
Recording Sales and Returns chapter will be displayed.
 6. Repeat for other workstations, selecting the appropriate PDF file to 
display for each

Printing Customer IDs on Labels
 Using Document Designer, you can print customer mailing labels that can 
include the Customer ID in barcode and human-readable form. Some stores print 
and laminate mailing labels for use as customer identification cards. If the 
label includes the customer's Retail Pro Customer ID in barcode, then a cashier 
can scan the barcode to quickly write the customer on a document or find the 
customer's record in the customer file

Zip code lookup
 If you have set up your system to use ZIP/Postal Code Lookup, entering the 
ZIP code will automatically write the corresponding city, state, and/or country 
information on the customer record (see usage for the ZIP field described 
previously in the customer fields table). If you enter a nine-digit zip code, 
such as 12345-6789, including the hyphen, the system will ignore the four-digit 
extension and look for an entry that matches the first five digits.

Portable Readers
 A large number of tagged items can be conveniently listed on documents by 
scanning using a portable reader. The data encoded on the tag can be any of the 
three Retail Pro lookup numbers: Item #, UPC #, or ALU. Both the lookup number 
and the quantity scanned are temporarily stored in the portable unit and later 
transmitted to the computer running Retail Pro via a cable attached to a serial 
port. The reader only needs to be connected to the computer during the 
transmission. This is extremely convenient, especially when taking physical 
inventory or scanning received items to make a voucher.

More Than 500 Scanned Items from a Portable Terminal
 When downloading more than 500 items to a document, the first 500 items will 
be listed on the document as usual. Then, Retail Pro will alert you that there 
are more items to be processed. Update the first document, then begin a new 
document and select BARCODE to list the additional items. Update this document 
as well. We recommend scanning no more than 1000 items before downloading to a 
voucher.

Changing a Department Name
 Department names are stored only in the department file; only the code is 
recorded in inventory and on documents. Retail Pro looks up a department name 
in the department record when needed. Therefore, if you have changed the name 
for a department, the name displayed will be the current one.

Lead Time
 Lead time is the number of days that it typically takes from the time you 
order merchandise until the merchandise is received. You can predefine a lead 
time for each vendor. Lead times for items (if the item?s vendor has a lead 
time defined for it) are displayed on the Committed screen.
 1. Select SYSTEM PREFERENCES > MERCHANDISE > VENDORS > USER-DEFINED > Text 
Field Names: Enter LT as the name for one of the text fields.
 2. In the vendor module, enter the number of days of lead time for a 
particular vendor in the LT field.
 Note: You can also predefine a lead time for each item. Item lead times take 
precedence over vendor lead times. If you define no item lead times, then the 
vendors lead time, if any, will be shown on the Committed screen for that item. 
(Refer to Chapter 4. Inventory for more information.)

Ordering New Items
 At the Main station, you can easily add a new item to inventory as you list 
it on the SO.
 1. Select CHOOSE/EDIT ITEMS.
 2. Select NEW.
 3. Enter required fields and other fields, as desired, to record the item.
 4. Enter the Doc. Qty in the cell for the new item.
 5. Select OK from the side menu to return to the SO, adding the new item to 
it.

Physical Inventory Tips 
PI Preparation
 Being prepared is a step in the right direction for a good inventory. Make 
sure that your store has tags that are readable using a scanner.


 * Make sure everything that needs a tag has one. 
 * Make an inventory map before your inventory day so you know what area the 
information that has been scanned is coming from.
 * Have a meeting before you begin your inventory. Stress the importance of 
scanning EACH item or if doing a manual inventory make sure you write LEGIBLE.
 * Do not be open while trying to take a physical inventory. You are just 
asking for inaccuracies
 * Have a cut-off time for all transfers and vouchers between remote 
locations. You do not want merchandise moving around during an inventory.
 * If new merchandise comes in and you plan to pay for it during the next 
inventory period, leave it in the box and do not count it until after the 
inventory.
 * Analyze your existing inventory database. Do you have large negative 
quantities?

Use Caution When Editing Former Receipts
 Editing of former receipts makes permanent changes to your sales history file 
and may affect inventory if done before polling has taken place. It is the 
user's responsibility to ensure he is not corrupting historical sales 
information or creating false information.

Deleting Manually vs. "Cleaning House"
 Although you can manually delete items from inventory, it is usually better 
to use Clean House to erase items that are no longer needed. Clean House 
prevents you from deleting out-of-stock items that are committed on a PO, SO, 
or TO, or that have a non-zero company on-hand quantity. When Clean House 
erases an item from inventory, it also clears the entries for that row from a 
number of inventory-related files, making the row ready to use for a new item.

Starting to Track Adjustments
 We generally recommend that you start using adjustment tracking after you 
have done a complete physical inventory. This establishes your baseline. You 
will then be able to audit changes in inventory quantities and valuations back 
to the defined starting point.



 If you are installing Retail Pro in an existing business, we recommend that 
you turn off tracking until you have entered your entire inventory and then do 
a physical inventory.

Report Tips 
Reports
1. Offline Reporting
 Workstations accessing Retail Pro over a network read data files stored on 
the network server for reports. Retail Pro offers offline reporting, an 
important feature that allows a workstation to access a secondary set of data 
files (stored on the network or locally), allowing for more flexibility and 
speed when running reports.

2. Restore Minimized Report(s)
 If a report is minimized in the Previewer, the RESTORE feature becomes active 
throughout the reports module. Select RESTORE from the side menu to maximize 
the report. If multiple reports are minimized, all are maximized when RESTORE 
is selected. If reports are reduced from full screen to window, you can arrange 
the windows to display multiple reports at once.

3. Filter Wizard vs. New/Edit/Edit Filter
 FILTER WIZARD takes you through a step-by-step process to create/modify a 
report filter. To make quick modifications, or to work in an order of your own 
preference, it is recommended that you use NEW, EDIT, or EDIT FILTER , as 
appropriate. The same functions are available whether you use the wizard or 
NEW/EDIT/EDIT FILTER.

4. Create Report Groups (within a Category) "On the Fly"
 Select the category. When the list of reports is displayed, use or to 
highlight multiple reports. Then select PRINT to run this "on the fly" group of 
category reports.

5. Scheduling a Single Report
 Only report groups can be scheduled. If you want to schedule a single report, 
simply create a group that contains only that report.

Note: Where Did my Records Go???
 When you sort by a column heading, only the records that have an entry in 
that column will be displayed. This can make it appear that many of your 
records have disappeared, when in fact they are simply not being displayed. To 
display all fields again, sort by a column heading, such as Item #, that has an 
entry for all records.

Tip: Faster List View Displays
 In large data files, List View will display fastest when record number is 
used as the sort column (Item # in inventory, document number in document 
areas, etc.). This is because the records are stored in that order in the data 
files. When sorting by other columns, the program must scan the entire file and 
reorder the records accordingly. It is recommended you normally sort by record 
number, switching to another column only when needed to search for a specific 
record.

Keyboard Shortcuts 
 Use the following keyboard shortcut keys to quickly enter new times into time 
fields. If a time is specified in a field then the following commands will be 
relating to the displayed time. If there is not a time specified, the resultant 
entry will be relative to the displayed time. If there is not a time specified, 
the resultant entry will be relative to the current Retail Pro time.
 , Enter the current system time. , Move the time forward as many hours as 
the number entered. For example, if the displayed time is 1:00PM and you enter 
, , the time will be moved forward three hours to 4:00 PM
 , , Move time back as many hours as the number entered. For example, if 
the displayed time is 1:00PM and you enter , , the time will be moved 
back three hours to 10:00AM.
 Change the time to one hour ahead. 
 Change the time to one hour earlier.
 Set time to 12:00 AM.
 Set time to 11:59 PM.
 Set time one minute ahead. Only the minutes are changed, but not the hours. 
For example, if the time was 10:58PM then selecting three times would change 
the time to 10:59PM, 10:00PM, 10:01PM.
 Set the time one minute earlier than the current time displayed. Only the 
minutes are changed, not the hours. For example, if the time was 10:02PM then 
selecting three times would change the time to 10:01PM, 10:00PM, 10:59PM , Set 
the time to noon, 12:00 PM

Sortable Columns
 The columns that can be sorted in each module will vary depending on how you 
have configured your installation of Retail Pro. It order for a column to be 
sortable, it must be an index. ( An index is a file that contains specific 
information on the location of Retail Pro records. ) In addition to the default 
indexes, in some modules ( such as receipts and inventory ) additional indexes 
can be defined by the user. This is done in RPRO DB. If a multiple field index 
is chosen, the first field in that index will be the sortable field

Starting to Track Adjustments
 We generally recommend that you start using adjustment tracking after you 
have done a complete physical inventory. This establishes your baseline. You 
will then be able to audit changes in inventory quantities and valuations back 
to the defined starting point.



 If you are installing Retail Pro in an existing business, we recommend that 
you turn off tracking until you have entered your entire inventory and then do 
a physical inventory.

Indexes and Sortable Columns
 The columns that can be sorted will vary depending on how you have configured 
your installation of Retail Pro. In order for a column to be sortable, it must 
be an index (a file that contains specific information on the location of 
Retail Pro records.) The default index fields for each area are indicated in 
the Fields section of each individual chapter. In addition to the default 
indexes, in some places (such as RECEIPTS and INVENTORY) additional indexes can 
be defined by the user. This is done in RPRO DB. If a multiple field index is 
chosen, the first field in that index will be the sort able field. (Refer to 
specific chapters and Tool Supplement TS10. RPRO DB for more information.)

Point of Sale Tips 
Recording Tax-Exempt Sales
 A good way to handle tax exempt sales is to predefine a tax area with a 0% 
tax rate and then select that tax area when making a tax-exempt receipt. Using 
this method allows you to report tax-exempt sales by filtering on the defined 
0% tax area. If you have tax-exempt customers, assign them the tax area with 0% 
tax in the customer file to insure their purchases are automatically recorded 
with no tax.

Using Jackpot Items to Record Fees and Miscellaneous Charges
 Miscellaneous fees, particularly for services, can be listed in the document 
item list on receipts. Jackpot items can be used for this purpose. Create 
jackpot item(s) in inventory for this use with the appropriate department code 
and the name of the fee as its description (i.e. Wrapping). Flag them as 
Non-Inventory Items. In this way, you can enter the jackpot item on the 
receipt, edit its price and description as needed, and update. The 
non-inventory flag means the quantity on-hand in inventory will always be shown 
as zero, and the item will not show up in on-hand item reports. The fees listed 
this way will be reported as normal sales on reports.

Changing Item Associate
 Changing the associate for an individual item does not affect the associate 
for the receipt.

Changing the Quantity of Promotional Pricing Items
 If you change the quantity of a promotional pricing item, the system will 
check if the current receipt price matches the item price in inventory for the 
currently active price level. If the receipt price is less than the inventory 
price, a prompt is displayed, informing you that the price will revert back to 
the item's inventory price. Select YES to change the receipt price back to the 
item price. If you select no, the cursor will remain in the quantity field, so 
that you can change the quantity back if you wish.

Updating Discounts After Changing the Quantity Sold
 If you need to change the quantity being sold after applying promotional 
pricing simply return to the receipt item list and change the quantity. When 
you select TENDER again, select APPLY if the dialog appears again to apply the 
new pricing.

Discounts Before Adding Customer
 If items are added to a document before a customer is added, and discounts 
are given to any of the items listed on the document, subsequently listing a 
customer with a defined discount will override the previous item discount with 
the defined customer discount.

Cashier Changing the Customer Discount
 A cashier's ability to edit a customer discount is limited by that cashier's 
discount maximum as defined in system preferences. The cashier is only allowed 
to change the discount to the maximum discount allowed for the cashier (even if 
the customer discount is higher than the percentage allowed for the user).

Pro Tip: Giving Cash Back While Ringing Up a Purchase
 To give cash back while processing a purchase by a tender other than cash:
 1. Enter the amount of cash to be returned to the customer as a negative 
number first. For example, if the customer wants $50 back, enter - 50.
 2. Select CASH from the tender toolbar. The screen will show $50 cash is due 
in change. By entering the amount of cash back first, the new undefined amount 
displays how much the customer owes (including the amount due for the cash you 
are returning to the customer).
 3. Tender the new undefined amount as usual. 

Warning: Use Caution When Editing
 Editing of former receipts makes permanent changes to your sales history file 
and may affect inventory if done before polling has taken place. It is the 
user's responsibility to ensure he is not corrupting historical sales 
information or creating false information.

Debit Cards Do Not Need to Be Settled
 Unlike credit card and gift card transactions, debit card transactions do not 
need to be settled. However, debit card transactions are included in EFT batch 
reports for thorough EFT reporting.

Using SOs to Write Customer Quotes
 You can easily write and submit quotes for goods or services to customers, 
without committing the items or service, by using registry SOs for this 
purpose. Design your SO form and print design files to include the information 
fields you need. When a customer accepts a quote, use the copy feature to 
quickly transfer the quoted sale to an active Customer Order SO. The "Quote SO" 
(registry SO) can then be deleted.

Gift Certificate
 A gift certificate is "store money" that can be used to purchase merchandise 
at some future date. When a customer buys a gift certificate, there is no net 
sale. The customer is paying in the amount of the certificate in one currency 
(such as cash) and receiving the same amount as change in the form of a gift 
certificate. Reports, including the x/z out reports track certificate purchases 
as Gift amounts paid out and redemptions as Gift amounts paid in.

To Sell A Gift Certificate
 1. Start a new receipt with no items listed and go to the tender screen
 2. Enter the amount of the gift certificate being purchased as a negative in 
the Undefined field.
 3. Select GIFT from the side toolbar. A dialog box will appear asking for the 
gift certificate number.
 4. Enter the number then select OK.
 5. It will show Change: GIFT for the amount you entered
 6. Tender the undefined amount as usual usng the tender types from the side 
toolbar.

To Redeem A Gift Certificate
 1. Ring a sale and tender the receipt normally.
 2. Enter the amount of the gift certificate then select GIFT.
 3. Record the certificate number into the dialog box then select OK.
 4. Tender any change in the normal way. 

Leading Zeroes
 When typing in an item number, it is not necessary to type any leading 
zeroes. For example, to enter item number 000555, you need only type 555.

Using choose/edit items 
 Use CHOOSE/EDIT ITEMS instead of choose items when you want to go into 
inventory and edit items before bringing the items to the slip. You have full 
editing capability using CHOOSE/EDIT ITEMS.

Create a Separate Price Level for Original Prices 
 For maximum flexibility when restoring prices, create a separate secure price 
level in inventory for your original prices. This price level won't be used at 
POS; it will only be used to store original prices. Then in system preferences 
select LAST MARKDOWN as the price to keep when updating markdowns. You can now 
make markdowns knowing that you can restore prices to either the last markdown 
price or the original price, if necessary. To restore prices to their most 
recent pre-markdown price (the last markdown) simply select RESTORE to restore 
prices to their original price, use Price Manager to copy prices from the 
"original price" price level to the price level with which you are currently 
working.

Tracking Global Discount Types 
 Discount types in Retail Pro are stored with item records. Therefore, a 
discount type can only be specified for global discounts if they are spread 
among the receipt items. To record a reason when giving an unspread global 
discount, predefine a discount reason or reasons in your comment list in 
preferences. Then when giving an unspread discount, enter the reason in a 
Comment field. Sales reports tracking global discount can then be generated by 
filtering on the Comment fields.

Promotional Pricing vs. Quantity Pricing 
 Promotional pricing allows you to assign any items or styles to a promotion 
so that you can price those items lower when selling them at greater 
quantities. When listing promotional items on a receipt, the quantity being 
sold for all items assigned to the same promotion will be summed. Retail Pro 
will then use promotional pricing on the receipt; the discounted price will 
automatically be entered for each of those items.



 Quantity pricing allows you to define different prices to be automatically 
applied when listing a single item in different quantities on a receipt by 
using price levels. This method records the price to be used for each quantity 
range sold on the individual item.

Freight Costs
 Retail Pro® allows you to spread freight costs to the cost of the items. 
Freight can be treated as a separate charge or it can be spread ? added 
proportionally to the cost of all items received.

Independent SO Customer Information 
 The customer information brought to the SO becomes part of the SO record, 
independent of the customer file. If you edit the customer file, the SO will 
not be updated; likewise, editing the SO customer information will not affect 
the customer file.

Customer Discounts Cancel Previous Document Discounts 
 Adding a customer with an assigned customer discount to a document that 
already has discounts applied (whether to individual items or a global 
discount) results in the cancellation of the other discounts. For example, 
let's say customer James Johnson has a 10% customer discount assigned, and he 
purchases an item that is 15% off. If you first list the item on the receipt, 
THEN add Johnson as the Bill To customer, the 15% item discount will be 
overwritten by Johnson's 10% customer discount. On the other hand, if you list 
Johnson on the document first, and then list the item, the item discount will 
be applied, overwriting the assigned customer discount.

Customer Tax Area 
 Customer tax areas may be overridden if the user manually changes tax area 
information on a document. The customer tax area feature only sets the tax area 
at the time the customer is added to the document. Any manipulation of the tax 
area after that may cancel out the customer tax area.

This is a guest post by Joannes Vermorel, founder of the Lokad Forecasting 
Service .

Software developers seem to be herd animals. They like to stay very close to 
each other. As a result, the marketplace ends up riddled withhundreds of ToDo 
lists 

 while other segments are deserted, despite high financial stakes. During my 
routine browsing of software business forums, I have noticed that the most 
common answer toWhy the heck are you producing yet another ToDo list? is the 
desperately annoyingBecause I can’t find a better idea.

This is desperately annoying because the world is full (saturated even) with 
problems so painful that people or companies would be very willing to pay to 
relieve the pain, even if only a little. A tiny fraction of these problems are 
addressed by the software industry (such as the need for ToDo lists), but most 
are just lacking any decent solution.

Hence, I detail below 3 low-competition software niches in retail. Indeed, 
after half a decade of runningsales forecasting software company Lokad 
, I believe, despite the potential survivor bias 
, 
that I have acquired insights on a few B2B markets close to my own. Firstly I 
will address a few inevitable questions:

Q: If you have uncovered such profitable niches, why don’t you take over them 
yourself?
 A: Mostly because running a growing business already takes about 100% of my 
management bandwidth.

Q: If these niches have little competition, entry barriers must be high?
 A: Herding problems aside, I believe not.

Q: Now these niches have been disclosed, they will be swarmed over by 
competitors, right?
 A: Odds are extremely low on that one. The herd instinct is just too strong.

Q. Do I have to pay you if I use one of your ideas?
 A. No, I am releasing this into the public domain. I expect no payment if you 
get rich (unless you want to!) and accept no liability if you fail miserably. 
Execution is everything.  And don’t trust a random stranger on the Internet – 
do your own market research.

Before digging into the specifics of those niches, here are a couple of signs 
that I have noticed to be indicators of desperate lack of competition:


 * No one bothers about doing even basic SEO. 
 * No prices on display. 
 * No one offers self-signup – you have to go through a sales rep. 
 * Little in the way of online documentation or screenshots are available. 
However,lack of competition does not mean lack of competitors. It’s just not 
the sort of competition that keeps you up at night. Through private one-to-one 
discussions with clients of those solutions, here is the typical feedback I get:


 * Licenses are hideously expensive. 
 * Setup takes months. 
 * Upgrade takes months (and is hideously expensive). 
 * Every single feature feels half-baked. By way of anecdotal evidence – 
during a manufacturer integration with our forecasting technology a few months 
ago at Lokad, we discovered that the client had been charged $2,000 by its 
primary software provider in order to activate Remote Desktop on the Windows 
Server where the software was installed. Apparently, this was well within the 
norm of their usual fees for the inventory management system in place.

Granted, just being cheaper is usually not a good place to be in the market. 
Yet, when a competitor’s software is designed in such a way that it takes a 
small army of consultants to get it up and running, they can’t just lower their 
license fees to match yours – assuming that your design is not half-baked too. 
The competition would have to redesign their solution from scratch, and give up 
on their consultingware revenues. So you are in a great position todrive 
competition crazy .

With a market managing over two-thirds of the US gross domestic product 
, 
one would expected retail be saturated by fantastic software products. It turns 
out this is not the case. Not by a long shot – except eCommerce (e.g. online 
shopping carts) which attracts azillion developers 

 for no good reason.

Some salient aspects of the retail software market:


 * Most retailers are already equipped in basic stuff such as point-of-sale, 
inventory management and order management systems. So you don’t have to deliver 
that yourself. On the contrary, you should rely on the assumption that such 
software is already in place. 
 * As far the Lokad experience goes with its online sales forecasting service, 
retailers are not unwilling to disclose their data to a 3rd party over the 
Internet. It takes trust and trust takes time. Interestingly enough, at Lokad 
we do sign NDAs, but rather infrequently. We are not unwilling, but most 
retailers (even top 100 worldwide ones) simply don’t even bother. 
 * Retailers have a LOT of data, and yet unlike banks, they have little 
talented manpower to deal with it. Many retail businesses are highly profitable 
though and could afford to pay for this kind of manpower, but as far I can 
tell, it’s just not part of the usual Western retail culture. Talents go to 
management, not to the trenches. Niche 1: EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) 
calculator

Retailers know they need to keep their stocks as low as possible, while 
preserving their service levels (aka rate of non stock-outs), see thissafety 
stock tutorial 
 for 
more details. If the marginal ordering cost for replenishment was zero, then 
retailers would produce myriads of incremental replenishment orders, precisely 
matching their own sales. This is not the case. One century ago, F. W. Harris 
introduced the economic order quantity (EOQ) which represents the optimal 
quantity to be ordered at once by the retailer, when friction factors such as 
the shipping cost are taken into account. Obviously, the Wilson Formula (see
Wikipedia  for details) 
is an extremely early attempt at addressing the question. It’s not too hard to 
see that many factors are not accounted for, such as non-flat shipping costs, 
volume discounts, obsolescence risks …etc.

Picking the right quantity to order is obviously a fundamental question for 
each retailer performing an inventory replenishment operation. Yet, AFAIK, 
there is no satisfying solution available on the market.ERP 
 systems just 
graciously let the retailer manually enter the EOQ along with other product 
settings. Naturally, this process is extremely tedious, firstly because of the 
sheer number of products, secondly because whenever a supply parameter is 
changing, the retailer has to go through all the relevant products all over 
again.

The EOQ calculator would typically come as multi-tenant web app. Main 
features being:


 * Product and supplier data import from any remotely reachable SQL 
database[1]. 
 * Web UI for entering / editing EOQ settings. 
 * EOQ calculation engine. 
 * Optional EOQ export back to the ERP. Pricing guestimate: Charge by the 
number of products rather than by the number of users. I would suggest to start 
around $50/month for small shops and go up to $10k/month for large retail 
networks.

Gut feeling: EOQ seemingly involves a lot of expert knowledge (my take: 
acquiring this knowledge is a matter of months, not years). So there is an 
opportunity to position yourself as an expert here, which is a good place to be 
as it facilitates inbound marketing and PR with specialized press. Also, EOQ 
can be narrowed down to sub-verticals in retail (e.g. textiles) in case 
competition grows stronger.

Niche 2: Supplier scorecard manager

For a retailer, there are about 3 qualities that define a good supplier: 
lowest prices, shortest shipment delays, best availability levels (aka no items 
out-of-stock delaying the shipments). Better, sometime exclusive, suppliers 
give a strong competitive edge to a retailer. Setting aside payment terms and 
complicated discounts, comparing supplier prices is simple, yet, this is only 
the tip of the iceberg. If the cheapest supplier doesn’t deliver half of the 
time, “savings” will turn into very expensivelost sales. As far I can observe, 
beyond pricing, assessing quality of the suppliers is hard, and most retailers 
suffer an ongoing struggle with this issue.

An idea that frequently comes to the mind of retailers is to establish 
contracts with suppliers that involve financial penalties if delays or 
availability levels are not enforced. In practice, the idea is often 
impractical. Firstly, you need to be Walmart-strong to inflict any punitive 
damage on your suppliers without simply losing them. Secondly, shipping delays 
and availabilities needs to be accurately monitored, which is typically not the 
case.

A much better alternative, yet infrequently implemented outside the large 
retail networks, consists of establishing a supplier scorecard based on the 
precise measuring of both lead times (i.e. the duration between the initial 
order and the final delivery) and of the item availability. The scorecard is a 
synthetic, typically 1-page, document refreshed every week or every month that 
provides the overall performance of each supplier. The scorecard includes a 
synthetic score like A (10% best performing suppliers), B and C (10% worst 
performing suppliers). Scorecards are shared with the suppliers themselves.

Instead of punishing bad suppliers, the scorecard helps them in realizing 
there is a problem in the first place. Then, if the situation doesn’t improve 
after a couple of months, it helps the retailer itself to realize the need for 
switching to another supplier…

The scorecard manager web app would feature:


 * Import of both purchase orders and delivery receipts (this might be 2 
distinct systems). [2] 
 * Consolidation of per-supplier lead time and availability statistics. 
 * One-page scorecard reports with 3rd party access offered to the suppliers. 
Pricing guestimate: Charge based on the number of suppliers and the numbers of 
orders to be processed. Again, the number of users having access to the system 
might not be a reliable indicator. Starting at $50/month for small shops up to 
$10k/month for large retail networks.

Gut feeling: By positioning your company as intermediate between retailers 
and their suppliers, you benefit from a built-in viral marketing effect, which 
is rather unusual in B2B. On the other hand, there isn’t that much expert 
knowledge (real or assumed) in the software itself.

Niche 3: Dead simple sales analytics

Retail is a fast-paced business, and a retailer needs to keep a really close 
eye on its sales figures in order to stay clear of bankruptcy. Globally, the 
software market is swarming with hundreds of sales analytics tools, most of 
them being distant competitors of Business Objects acquired by SAP years ago. 
However, the business model of most retailers is extremely simple and 
straightforward, making all those Business Intelligence tools vast overkill for 
small and medium retail networks.

Concepts that matter in retail are: sales per product, product categories and 
points of sale. That’s about it. Hence, all it should take to have a powerful 
sales visualization tool setup for a retailer should be access to the 2 or 3 
SQL tables of the ERP defining products and transactions; and the rest being 
hard-coded defaults.

Google Analytics would be an inspiring model. Indeed, Google does not offer 
to webmasters any flexibility whatsoever in the way the web traffic is 
reported; but in exchange, setting-up Google Analytics requires no more than 
merely cutting-and-pasting a block of JavaScript into your web page footer.

Naturally it would be a web app, with the main features being:


 * Product and sales data import from any remotely reachable SQL database.[2] 
 * Aggregate sales per day/week/month. 
 * Aggregate per product/product category/point-of-sales. 
 * A Web UI ala Google Analytics, with a single time-series graph per page. 
Pricing guestimate: Regular per-usage fee, a la Salesforce.com. Starting at 
$5/user/month basic features to $100/user/month for more fancy stuff.

Gut feeling: probably the weakest of the 3 niches, precisely because it has 
too much potential and is therefore doomed to attract significant attention 
later on. Also, achieving awow effect on first contact with the product will 
probably be critical to turn prospects into clients.

Market entry points

Worldwide, there are plenty of competitors already for these niches. Yet, 
again, this does not mean much. Firstly because retail is so huge, secondly 
because it’s a heavily fragmented market anyway. First, there are big guys like 
SAP, JDA or RedPrairie, typically way too expensive for anything but large 
retail networks. Second, there are hundreds of mid-market ERPs, typically with 
a strong national (or even regional) focus. However, those ERPs don’t delve 
into fine-grained specifics of retail, as they are too busy already dealing 
with a myriad of feature requests for their +20 modules (accounting, billing, 
HR, payments, shipping … etc). Hence, there is a lot of space for razor-sharp 
web apps that focus on one, and only one, aspect of the retail business. 
Basicallysingle-minded, uncompromising obsession with one thing 
, leaving aside all other 
stuff to either ERPs or other web apps.

In order to enter the market, the good news is that mid-size retailers are 
pretty much everywhere. So you can just use a tiny bit of networking to get in 
touch with a couple of neighbouring businesses, even if you don’t have that 
much of a network in the first place. Then, being razor-sharp in a market where 
very little online content is available, offers you a cheap opportunity at 
doing some basic SEO based on the very specific questions your software is 
addressing.

Q: I am interested, I have questions, can I ask you those questions?
 A: Naturally, my rate is 200€/h (no just kidding). Yes, email me 
.

[1] Don’t even bother about providing a super-complicated setup wizard. Just 
offer a $2k to $5k setup package that includes the ad-hoc handful of SQL lines 
to match the existing data of the retailer. We are already using this approach 
at Lokad withSalescast 
. 
Alternatively, we also offer anintermediate SQL schema 
, if the retailer is willing to 
deal with the data formatting on its own.

[2] Again, I suggest an approach similar to the one of Salescast by Lokad: 
don’t even try to robotize data import, just design the software in such a way 
that adding a custom adapter is cheap.

Great article as usual, with lots of food for thought.

In item #2 in the “salient aspects of the retail software market” list, did 
you mean to write “retailers are not unwilling” or “retailers are unwilling”?

Christopher Bruno 8 June 2011 at 5:29 pm 

Thank you…niche 3 has been sitting in my head for some time but i have yet to 
convince myself that other busineses will pay for it from a small shop. This 
post has gotten me reinterested.

I meant “retailers are not unwilling”, in other words, gaining access their 
data is OK if you do it the proper way.

Jonathan Matthews  8 June 2011 at 7:17 pm 

Thanks Joannes, excellent article. We hear a lot of “find a niche” advice 
without many concrete ideas. I think many people will find this very useful. If 
not to use those niches then to encourage them to think outside the box.

Mark Blackwell 8 June 2011 at 11:38 pm 

Great article. What do you think of the argument that enterprise software needs 
to be either:
 1. Cheap and shrink-wrapped, <$1000 and without any handholding in the sales 
or setup process OR
 2. $50k+, with an in-person sales process
 with no profitable space between these two price points.

Joel on software made this point a while back (
http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html 
 about 2/3 
down the page)

Point is that anything that falls into the middle of these two price points 
is very hard to serve profitably… the costs of finding and selling the 
customers are too high.

Joannes Vermorel  9 June 2011 at 8:06 am 

Mark,

Well, Joel Spolsky is certainly a great mind, but AFAIK, he hasn’t 
experienced non-geek B2B much. His only attempt with StackExchange certainly 
does not like a big success as far his B2B wannabe clients are concerned
http://vermorel.com/journal/2010/4/17/stack-exchange-20-epic-fail.html 
 

Back to the pricing point, first I know dozens of counter example to this 
statement. Why would intensive on-site sales rep and do-it-alone be the only 
two pricing points that works? There are many in-between, the amount of 
dedicated personal attention growing with the pricing.

Just to name one: http://www.stoneedge.com/ 

Again, don’t get distracted by Google (all-automated, cheap if not free) and 
Oracle (dedicated rep, expensive), they are just the extreme.

I have written #3. Seriously. 8 man years of development, it is fast and slick. 
We have had a production deployment for 2.5 years. Now how do I sell this? It 
is extremely hard. We took no funding and bootstrapped.

Are you referring to Insight Industries? After 10min on your website, I am 
still having hard time to figure out what “Haystack” is supposed to be doing. 
Then, as far I can tell, it’s completely unfocused on retail: two case studies 
are manufacturing companies. Latest Tweet is 110 days old… Sorry, but at this 
stage, I would say you did not even try #3.


 * 9 

John Harrison  9 June 2011 at 7:59 pm 

I appreciate your feedback. Not sure that I agree that I haven’t tried to make 
a dead simple sales analytics system, as that is what we’ve got, but perhaps I 
could express that more elegantly.


 * 10 

Joannes Vermorel  9 June 2011 at 8:24 pm 

> John Harrison

Sorry to be harsh, no matter how good is your product ‘Haystack’, I believe 
it is suffering from a vastly dysfunctional website that deter about 99% of 
your prospects.

My 4 points about “under-competing” products:
 - No one bothers about doing even basic SEO. => Did you do SEO for Haystack? 
No
 - No prices on display. => Does Haystack expose a public price? No
 - No one offers self-signup => Haystack does not offer self-signup either.
 - Little in the way of online documentation or screenshots are available. => 
Haystack has about 300 words of online docs and no screenshots.

We are not talking here about rephrasing the content in a more elegant way, 
the entire website and marketing approach are missing entirely.

(Shameless Plug) If you truly believe your product is good, then I would 
strongly suggest you to hire a consultant like Andy to fix the most obvious 
broken parts of your web marketing strategy. That’s likely to be an overnight 
game changer for your business.


 * 11 

John Harrison  9 June 2011 at 8:43 pm 

I do believe the product is good and readily admit my shortcomings when it 
comes to marketing. I will talk to my partner and consider contacting Andy. 
Thanks.

Rishi Agarwal  10 June 2011 at 10:38 am 

Very nice article. I am currently working on a product for the retail industry 
and found this blog helpful as it validated my thoughts.

Do you think cold calling and personal visits in this niche market is an 
effective way of doing sales? Does it help in the beginning?


 * 13 

Joannes Vermorel  10 June 2011 at 11:07 am 

We don’t do cold calling. We tried, but it seems much less effective than SEO. 
Then, we only visit super large retailers.

Although, at the very beginning, everything goes. It’s OK to invest 1 week of 
effort for a 100€/month client. What really matter is to learn as much as 
possible from your first prospects, and to optimize later on.

Karl Thompson  12 June 2011 at 7:04 pm 

I like your niche 1 idea. Only because I’ve been selling an EOQ calculator as 
part of my SolveIT! program since 1985. (SolveIT! is a collection of over 40 
financial calculators.)

And currently if you do a search on either ‘EOQ calculator” or “Economic 
Ordering Quantity calculator” on Google, we land in about the 5 or 6 spot on 
the first page for either phrase.

My experience has been that there is no intrinsic demand for this calculator. 
Now, out calculator does not have all the features that you suggest and it can 
certainly be improved, I’ve also got to tell you though, in the 20 plus years 
of selling it, I’ve only had maybe two people contact us with suggestion for 
features or changes.

My sense is, before this calculator can be sold, the potential market as to 
be educated as to its importance. That a hurdle to overcome. (Lots of resources 
required to initiate an educational campaign.) Additionally, I think an ROI 
model has to be developed that documents the value of the calculation.

I’m not prepared to make the upfront investment required. On the other hand, 
if you know any business that want’s one, I would take it on as a consulting 
project for a very reasonable fee (certainly less than what you are suggesting 
for a license fee to a large user).

> Karl from pine-grove.com

Sorry to be harsh again, my intent is really not bash every single commenter 
here, yet, I am afraid, you’ve missed most critical ingredients.

First, EOQ ala Wilson is vastly useless: this 1-line equation was maybe good 
at the beginning of 20th century, but 21th century retailers expect a LOT more. 
Then, you can’t expect retailers to come back to you with expect advices! At 
Lokad, we certainly don’t expect our clients to improve our statistical 
forecasting algorithms…

Second, you need to get marketing basics right, why would any retailer in 
their right mind purchase a product with only 29 words of description! (that 
the exact amount of content available on Pine Groove). Retailers won’t find you 
because of the EOQ keyword, they will find you because you’ve got 
retail-specific SEO strategy with many supply chain related content. 
Pine-Groove has none. Worse, your calculators are branded as *financial*, why 
is like saying “This product is NOT relevant for supply chain”.

Third, since the early 80s, the market has tremendously evolved. A 
stand-alone calculator has a usefulness close to zero: the retailer is not 
going to re-enter manually a dozen of parameters each time she is making an 
order! The calculator needs to be seamlessly integrated with the ERP – which 
did not exist in the 80s for most retailers.

In my book, you haven’t tried yet.

Chuck Brooks  12 June 2011 at 11:23 pm 

Great insights and tips that apply beyond the retail industry. One thing that 
has worked well for us is exhibiting at trade shows. We’ve noticed that owners 
and line managers seldom can articulate real from wishes, but the non verbal 
feedback is often surprising and, more often than not, rewarding.


 * 17 

Ron Steffler 17 July 2011 at 6:40 pm 

Joannes,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts, it’s refreshing to see a “find a niche” ISV 
post actually offering concrete suggestions. The EOQ calculator idea gets 
interesting after you scratch the surface. I wonder why this niche would have a 
lack of established solutions… herding instinct doesn’t feel sufficient enough 
to explain. Perhaps the potential cost savings of a detailed calculation is not 
large enough to warrant the extra effort/cost of a detailed EOQ calculation? Or 
maybe organizational boundries make it too hard to get quality input of the 
different factors?

I’m also curious about your pricing guesstimate, what are your thoughts on 
how many products a small or large shop would handle?

Bien cordialement

Joannes Vermorel  17 July 2011 at 6:54 pm 

Hi Ron,

Sometimes, it takes years to spot the obvious. It took me about 6 years to 
realize the OOS (Out-Of-Shelf) optimization was a much desired app for 
retailers, and that OOS optimization was primarily relying on good forecasts, 
see
http://blog.lokad.com/journal/2011/6/19/shelfcheck-on-shelf-availability-optimizer-announced.html
 


I am guessing that EOQ is the same sort of problem that you can ignore for 
years even while working on an inventory management system.

Concerning the number of products, the ranges vary from 200 items to 1000k 
items from the smallest B2C shop to the large industrial B2B wholesalers.

As far pricing goes, if you app can save more than a few hours per user per 
month, then you can price $100 / user / month. Then, your mileage may vary 
depending on the added value of your app, beyond saving time. If it does save 
money too (smarter purchases), then added-value is much higher (and so can be 
the price).

With Retail Returns Management, Oracle is tackling the growing problem of 
fraudulent returns, which cost retailers about $9.6 billion per year, according 
to the National Retail Federation. Oracle says the software lets users 
accurately process returns across all stores through real-time return 
authorizations that screen for fraud by analyzing return behavior and 
identifying specific return patterns. The goal, said Sean Ford, Oracle's vice 
president of retail marketing, is to detect and deter criminals who take 
advantage of return polices to launder money, return used items and receive 
cash for stolen goods.

Oracle Retail Returns Management also helps retailers ensure that all returns 
are from legitimate purchases and that employees are following store policies, 
Ford said.

Oracle Returns Management is unique because users can put highly dynamic 
return policies in place, Baird said. For instance, a company's biggest 
customer might also be the one who returns the most items, so it's probably not 
a good idea to hold that customer to the same return policies as most.

"I don't know anybody else who has that particular facet of their return 
policy management solution," Baird said. "They're taking stuff that's happening 
at point-of-sale and they're marrying it against customer tracking information 
within their loyalty application."

Ford said Oracle Retail Promotion Planning and Optimization combines 
planning, forecasting and analytics to help retailers profit more from special 
sales and promotions. It does so by analyzing the drivers of customer demand 
and the effectiveness of past promotions, he said.

Oracle says the promotion planning software lets users predict how much 
inventory to purchase and which inventory to promote on a location-by-location 
basis. It includes a graphical user interface and a centralized calendar view 
that can aid in planning promotions across multiple advertising channels.

Two differing approaches 

Oracle and SAP have distinctly different approaches to the retail software 
market, Baird said.

 

Oracle, Baird said, wants customers to think of them as a one-stop-shop, 
best-of-breed, An uphill battle?  


Even if the U.S. audience is more receptive to Oracle, the company still has 
its work cut out for it in terms of getting retailers to adopt new technology. 
Historically, Baird said, retailers have lagged behind other industries in the 
adoption of new technologies -- especially when it comes to things like 
enterprise resource planning (ERP) and integrated software suites. 


"I think in general, technology resources in the retail industry are a little 
more educated about what kinds of commitments you have to make if you're going 
to go down an ERP or a retail suite path," Baird said. "They're thinking about 
it, but they haven't started acting on it yet."

 Working with 
Technology Vendors


 * How do I choose a vendor? 
 
 * Should I buy or lease a retail POS system? 
  
Should I choose a retail software 
package that was designed specifically for my industry? 

Answer: Not necessarily. While there are many industry-specific software 
packages available, many of them don't offer all of the features available in a 
general retail software package. Often times, a general retail software package 
can do everything that industry-specific software can do, plus a whole lot 
more. Ask yourself what features you need now and in the future. Do you want a 
customer loyalty program? Do you need faster credit card authorizations over 
the Internet? What about aDashboard view of your key performance indicators 
?

Make sure that you don't lock yourself into industry-specific retail software 
that can't handle all of your needs.

 How much does a retail POS system 
cost? 

Answer: Like buying a car, it just depends on what you want. What features do 
you need? How fast do you want it to go? Should you purchase an extended 
warranty? The more features you want, the more your retail POS system will 
cost. A single-user software license can cost between $1,200 and $2,500. Do you 
need new POS terminals? Add $3,000 to $4,000 per workstation. What about new 
scanners, cash drawers, and printers? Add another $900 for each workstation. 
Extended warranties can add $200 per year, but are worth it if your workstation 
ever goes down. A top-of-the-line extended warranty will cost even more, but 
may be worth it if it's one that offers same-day delivery for a brand new, 
fully-configured workstation.

Before you buy any retail point of sale system, do the research. Choosing the 
wrong retail POS system can cost you thousands.

 There are so many different retail 
POS systems out there. How will I know how to choose the right one? 

Answer: First and foremost, take the time to understand the specific needs of 
your store. Establish your total technology budget. If necessary, break it down 
into the things you need this year and things that can wait until next year. 
Find reputable technology companies with years of expertise in the retail 
industry. Ask for references and call them. Many customers are happy to talk 
about their business challenges.

Consider all factors, such as retail software, technical support, service 
after the sale, point of sale hardware, and integration with accounting 
packages or other business software you use. Learn more about how tochoose the 
right retail POS system 
 for your 
business.



 Should I buy the point of sale 
hardware or the retail software first? 

Answer: The single biggest mistake retailers make when choosing a new retail 
POS system is buying the point of sale hardware before the retail software. The 
retail software you choose to run your retail business may not be compatible 
with your new point of sale hardware. Not all scanners, weight scales, or card 
readers will work with all retail software packages. Buying both the point of 
sale hardware and the retail software from the same vendor can reduce or 
eliminate compatibility issues and can often reduce your overall technology 
costs.

Check out the retail POS hardware basics 
 for more 
information on point of sale hardware.

 How will a retail POS system help 
me make more money? 

Answer: A retail POS system can help you increase your profits in many ways. 
Quicker, more reliable checkouts mean less manpower is needed. Sales reports 
allow you to maximize you inventory levels and control costs. Built-in loyalty 
programs encourage higher ticket averages and repeat business from your 
customers. Integrated ecommerce services generate additional revenue from 
Internet sales.

Talk to your technology consultant about other ways a retail POS system can 
help increase your bottom line.

 How can a retail POS system help 
me run my business more efficiently? 

Answer: A good retail POS system increases your efficiency by eliminating 
unnecessary work. Instead of using separate systems for your retail, mail 
order, ecommerce, and wholesale divisions, choose one retail software package 
that can manage your entire business. Choose a retail POS system that increases 
your speed of service with faster ticket entry, on-the-fly data entry, and 
data-driven lookups.

Make sure that the retail software you choose can automate all of your 
process-oriented tasks, such as physical count, purchasing, label printing, and 
customer loyalty.

 I have a lot of volunteers and 
elderly that work at my store. Isn't it too complicated to teach them how to 
work a computerized retail POS system? 

Answer: Learning the basics of a retail POS system is just as easy as 
learning to use a cash register, and if someone makes a mistake, it's much 
easier to correct that mistake on a point of sale system—plus you'll have a 
detailed transaction record of the mistake.

Many of today's user-friendly retail POS systems feature touchscreen 
technology. Your cashiers can use their fingertips or a mouse to touch the 
large, color-coded buttons to process sales. Any concerns you have about 
training seasonal employees or volunteers will be relieved when you see how 
easy touchscreen interface is.

 Is there a major convention for 
retail software providers? I want a live demo of a point of sale system. 

Answer:  There are thousands of retail industry trade shows across the 
country every year. There are trade shows for general retail as well as for 
specific retail industries.Find retail trade shows in your area 
 that plan to have at 
least one technology vendor demonstrating retail software and/or point of sale 
hardware.

 Additionally, most technology vendors will be happy to give you a free demo 
of their retail point of sale system at your request.

 I already have an electronic cash 
register, why should I spend the money for a retail POS system? 

Answer: While an electronic cash register is a suitable way to track money, 
installing a retail POS system will simplify your life as well as your 
customers'. With a retail point of sale system, you'll streamline operations, 
increase checkout times, make more money, increase efficiency, keep better 
inventory records, and have the most robust reporting capabilities right at 
your fingertips. The right retail point of sale system will pay for itself over 
and over again with its functionality.

 Is my store too small to benefit 
from a retail POS system? 

Answer: More than likely, you can't afford not to have a retail point of sale 
system. Today's retail POS systems come in all sizes and are designed to fit 
businesses of any size—from single location mom-and-pop shops to the 
mega-chains with thousands of locations. Do your research, distinguish your 
wants from your needs, and talk to some technology vendors. You'll find that 
there is a retail POS system out there that meets your needs—and your budget.

 I've seen retail software with 
hundreds of reporting options. Why do I need so many reports? 

Answer: The extensive reporting capabilities built into better retail 
software packages offer business owners and managers an in-depth look at their 
businesses. With a few clicks of a mouse, you can drill down into multiple 
layers of your report or create boardroom quality graphs and charts.

While you may not need every single report available in a particular retail 
software package, you do want to choose the retail software package with the 
most flexibility. Retail software that integrates with the industry-leading 
Crystal Reports® engine offer the most customization capabilities. If you want 
to be able to customize the built-in reports or create your own reports from 
scratch, make sure that the retail software you choose can handle it.

 What type of database should I 
choose? 

Answer: Any retail software package with inventory management and reporting 
features will have some underlying database. This database is where all of your 
items, customers, and sales history are stored. The underlying databases differ 
among various software manufacturers.

The key to choosing the right database lies in its format. You want to choose 
a broadly-understood data format that offers compatibility with third-party 
software applications. With the right data format, you can view your data just 
about any way you want to. For example, a retail software based on Microsoft 
SQL may offer compatibility with Crystal Reports® or Microsoft® Excel. 
Compatibility with third-party applications gives you unlimited reporting and 
analysis options.

Be sure choose a database architecture that ensures data integrity, so you 
know your data will always be accurate and reliable.

 Why is scalability important in 
retail software? 

Answer: A scalable retail software package will grow with you as your 
business grows. Choose a retail point of sale system that can readily 
accommodate additional users, additional workstations, and additional stores. 
When considering your future growth, keep in mind features you may one day 
need, such as multi-currency support or support for multiple tax rates across 
different regions. If history is a concern, make sure that the retail software 
you choose can store years and years of data.

 What is PCI DSS and why is it so 
important? 

Answer: PCI DSS, or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, is a 
strict set of standards designed to protect the cardholder's data from credit 
card fraud and misuse. ThePCI Security Standards Council 
 is an organization dedicated to the 
development and implementation of security standards for protecting credit card 
data. PCI Data Security Standards are developed and implemented by a 
collaborative effort from American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, 
MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa International.

If your retail software isn't compliant with PCI DSS, you may be subject to 
hefty fines. It's critical that you choose PCI-compliant retail software that 
will protect your customers' credit card information as well as your business.

Learn more about the 12 requirements of PCI DSS 
.

 How important are backups? 

Answer: Backups are critical. They protect your valuable business information 
from the unforeseen. Disasters—from hurricanes and floods to system failure or 
theft—can strike anyone, anytime, anywhere. Choose a retail POS system with 
easy-to-perform backup procedures. Keep a running log of your backups and make 
sure that someone is responsible the backups. It's also important to store your 
backups off site.

Learn more about keeping your retail software healthy 
.

 If my server goes down, can the 
clerks continue ringing up sales? 

Answer: If you want your clerks to be able to process sales without a server, 
choose retail software with lane redundancy or an offline mode. When point of 
sale workstations are 'offline' (i.e., not connected to the server), clerks can 
continue ringing up sales. When the connection to the server is reestablished, 
data from the local workstation is synchronized or replicated with the data on 
the server.

Offline POS systems can also work well for sidewalk sales, portable kiosks, 
and scheduled network outages.

 Do I need a software subscription 
service? 

Answer: Yes. When you purchase new retail software, you get the latest 
software release that's available on the date you purchase it. As new features 
are added to the retail software in subsequent releases, only those users with 
active subscription services will receive those updates. And no matter how good 
the retail software is, it may have a few bugs in it all.

Your subscription service will provide you with product updates, new 
features, and bug fixes for as long as your subscription service is active. 
Subscription services also encourage software companies to continue to invest 
resources in improving their retail software.

 I want a web store. Should I use a 
separate system for my ecommerce store? 

Answer: No. You should choose retail software with integrated ecommerce 
features. With an integrated system, you can use one retail software package to 
manage both your web store and your brick-and-mortar stores. An integrated 
ecommerce solution eliminates the extra effort and expense of maintaining 
inventory in multiple systems. If ecommerce is important to your business,learn 
more about ecommerce .

 How do I choose a vendor? 

Answer: Talk to more than one technology vendor. Just talking to vendors 
doesn't cost a thing, and you'll learn a lot about retail software and point of 
sale systems in the process. Don't just consider the retail POS systems 
available from each vendor. You also need to consider the vendor's location, 
areas of expertise, and number of years in business. Does the vendor offer 
extended support hours if you need them? If you have stores in multiple 
regions, can your vendor support all of your stores? Make sure that the vendor 
you choose can grow with you as your business grows.

Most importantly, choose a company you trust. The company you choose will be 
responsible for keeping your retail point of sale system running for the next 
5-7 years.

 Should I buy or lease a retail POS 
system? 

Answer: Whether you buy or lease a retail point of sale system depends on 
your budget. Many technology vendors today offer flexible leasing options for 
retail POS systems, including 100% financing. By leasing the retail software 
and/or the point of sale hardware, you can reduce the initial start-up costs 
associated with a new retail point of sale system.

Questions about OEM, ACADEMIC, and RETAIL BOX set versions WHAT IS OEM, AE, 
RETAIL SOFTWARE?

If you have questions on the difference between OEM, AE, and Retail Box Set 
products, this page should be helpful.


Software Type Retail BOX Manuals Software Features Manufacturer Support 
Retail Box Set YES YES YES YES Retail Box Set (AE- Academic) YES YES YES NO 
(some software company will give limited support) Academic Software (AE) NO 
Online-Manual (some product may come with the manual/some may not) YES NO(some 
software company will give limited support) Original Equipment Manufacturer 
(OEM) NO Online-Manual (some products may come with the manual/ some may not) 
YES, most OEM products include all features available in the Retail version of 
the software. We have reports thatMicrosoft has been known to take certain 
features out of OEM versions 
. NO 
Academic(AE) and OEM version software are distributed from the original 
manufacturer of the product, but have no original manufacturer support. The 
software carries the same features and online help-manuals as with an original 
RETAIL box set version. AE and OEM can both be registered with the 
manufacturer, but receives no product support from the manufacturer (i.e. 
Microsoft, Corel, Lotus) because it is sold at a discounted price. 

To sum it all up, when you purchase an Academic (non-retail box set) or OEM 
version of a product the 3 factors that you lose from a RETAIL BOX set version 
would be the following:

(1)Original Manufacturer Support for the Software, (2)Retail BOX, and 
(3)Manual (most products come with the online-manual and some may come with the 
original manual).

Excel Merging Problems

 There are two common reasons of why this area would be a problem for a user:
 
A) Even though our retail software 
 totally accommodates 
the transfer of the data from an Excel table, the software MS Excel 2000 or 
newer version is required to be installed on the given PC  for the transfer 
purposes (after the transfer is completed it is no longer required).
So do you have the program MS Excel 2000 or newer version on your PC?
 
B) Most of the problems we had so far regarding this area of the software are 
almost always cases where customers do not get the format of the Excel table 
right.  In order to eliminate this, we have made an Example Table, which is 
located in the "Merge from MS Excel" menu.  You can locate this menu by going 
to import data menu, Import from Excel.  Please click on the "Example Table" 
button.  Please make your Excel table is in this exact format or if it is 
easier for you just fill your items in this table and than use the merge option.

Avoiding the Ten Most Common Mistakes in 
Retail Technology 

One of the most frightening purchases that a retailer ever makes is their 
technology. The reason for this is that unlike inventory, which hopefully will 
sell in the next few weeks or months, the technology investment is for years. A 
mistake in inventory is often remedied by a series of markdowns. A mistake in 
technology can sometimes be remedied by bankruptcy court. For this reason, 
retailers have to be very careful of what they invest in.

Following are ten very common mistakes that I have not only made myself, but 
continue to see retailers make over and over again. The mistakes are not in 
order of magnitude, but any one could ruin a store.

1. Little or No Staff Training

Often, the single biggest mistake retailers make when implementing technology 
is to dismiss the importance of staff training. A store can have the very best 
software, but if no one understands it or knows how to use it properly, it 
could put a store out of business.

It is very important that money be budgeted for both hardware and software 
training. While it is true that sufficient training can cost up to eight times 
what is spent on software, minimum training exposes the retailer to more risk. 
This risk translates into frustrated customers, inadequate inventories, 
discontented sales people and ineffectual support staff. Therefore to reduce 
the risk, training expenditures must be increased.

Insist on four levels of training:

During the pre-install, time should be spent deciding the exact order of 
installation and how the installation will be executed. At this stage, training 
schedules should be created. During this pre-install time, the decisions on 
department/class should also be made. This session may take anywhere from half 
a day to five days, depending on the size of the retailer.

During installation, the staff should be trained. In larger stores, the 
trainers themselves are trained and they in turn instruct sales associates and 
support staff. Installation may be expected to last one to five days.

At the end of the first month, training should be conducted once again, since 
month-end reports must be generated and staff may have forgotten the previous 
training. One to four days should be set aside for this task.

Four to six months after installation, the retailer is finally ready to learn 
how to strategically use the system, so the Software Company must return to 
teach this strategic dimension. Only at this stage does the retailer receive 
pay back from the new technology.

2. Not Fully Understanding the Needs and Benefits

Some retailers have difficulty determining what their technology needs really 
are because their manual system of operation is not clearly defined from the 
start. The solution is to prepare a detailed needs analysis that includes every 
aspect of the store operations. This makes it easier to quantify benefits and 
cost-justify expenditures. The best way for retailers to know if a particular 
technology is suitable is to consult with other retailers in the same line of 
business that have implemented the same technology. Only experienced retail 
users can offer an honest appraisal. (Forms for this analysis are available for 
downloading on www.nrf.com  under the independent stores 
banner)

3. Buying Cheap Hardware and/or Software

Some retailers only want the cheapest hardware and software on the market. So 
they purchase unreliable hardware that puts their business at risk.

Quality technology costs money and you’ll get what you pay for.

Buy with the next two years in mind and buy the best technology you can 
afford. Follow these guides:


 * For high volume point-of-sale applications, budget $800 to $900 for a 
thermal printer. 
 * Don’t scrimp when it comes to scanners, input of SKU data is the most data 
intensive part of a retail business. The faster and more accurate the scanner, 
the more time you will save at POS. 
 * Join into a Maintenance Repair Contract that provides ‘tune-ups’ for the 
equipment at regular intervals. Establish one-day service or even one- or 
two-hour service for repairs and don’t let maintenance contracts lapse. 4. No 
Department/Class Discipline

If there are no departments, classes, sub-classes used, there is not way to 
interpret data and get increased efficiencies and sales. Therefore, classes and 
sub-classes must be clearly defined. Never have more than ten departments, 
never more than 10 classes per department and never more than 10 sub-classes 
per class.

Retailers must fully understand that their customers are the ones defining 
these categories by what they purchase. (Customers vote with their wallets!) 
Misinterpretation of POS data leads to faulty purchasing decisions, faulty 
markdowns and a host of other mistakes.

5. No Back up of Data, Unprotected System

It is very important that retailers back-up their system and it must be done 
correctly. Disaster could happen if tapes are old, worn out, kept on-site or 
exposed to magnetic fields. The best ways to avoid disaster is to:


 * Buy the best back up hardware available 
 * Replace back-up tapes frequently 
 * Perform a full system back up daily 
 * Verify weekly with full restore (best to a second hard drive used for this 
purpose only) 
 * Keep back-up back up tapes in fire proof safe and off site It is equally 
important to protect your system by scanning for viruses, implementing 
passwords and locking floppy drives. However, do not use a virus scan that is 
memory resident as it can cause more problems than it fixes. Make sure scanning 
is performed every time a floppy disk is used or each time a file is downloaded.

6. Underestimating or No Existing Data Conversion

If data in your current system is stored in an outdated format, decide what 
is really necessary to have on-line in your new system and convert that, then 
print out the remainder for a paper trail. Customer mailing lists, item masters 
and supplier files are relatively inexpensive to convert, but expenses mount 
quickly when converting transaction data.

7. No UPS

For each POS station, budget at least $200 for an uninterruptible power 
supply (UPS) with power chute software. Similarly, back-office workstations and 
servers also need adequate power protection. If this is not done it can result 
in lost data, incomplete polling, incomplete back ups, fried CPU’s, POS 
transactions lost and upset customers. The investment in this very simple piece 
of equipment will return greater savings than almost any other item in 
technology. Also remember to test your UPS monthly, they do wear out over time 
and the battery will not hold as much power.

8. Purchasing ‘One Size Fits All’ and ‘Modified’ Software

Never be the beta tester of software and if someone says modification, run.

It should be possible to find software that meets 95 percent of your needs. 
Look at programs that are used primarily by the same type of retailer, so that 
the majority of the enhancements and research and development will have been 
done to benefit your type of business. Software should be reasonably 
customizable, without the need for major modifications. And remember to stay in 
the upgrade path and never fall more than one release behind.

9. No Open-to-buy Plan and No Plan to Sell

Use an open-to-buy program every month and one that assists in planning sales 
and events. Re-key or move your actuals into it and do the same with cash flow. 
If this is not done, over buying and over inventory could occur and could cause 
a cash crunch every month. The best open to buy programs are spreadsheet driven 
and allow you to do many "what if" calculations as well as update each month as 
your real numbers come in.

10. Not Reading Documentation of Hardware and Software

If you believe ‘real men and women’ do not read manuals you could be 
under-utilizing your software. Don’t waste time with inefficient use of 
programs and equipment. Learn what causes errors and how to fix them. Always 
read the documentation that comes with your hardware and software. When a 
problem arises, check the documentation first, often the solution is right 
there. Also, remember when purchasing your hardware and software be sure it 
comes with on-line help and training.

Can you successfully avoid all of these mistakes? We hope that "an ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure."

 

Unraveling the Many Mysteries of the POS System 

It seems a lot of florists are a bit overwhelmed when it comes to choosing a 
POS system or even understanding what a POS system is. We put our technical 
expert James Dion to the task and had him answer the basic questions you had. 
Hope this helps!

What is a POS system in layman's terms?

A Point Of Sale, or even more importantly, a Point of Service system, is a 
computer that is used instead of the old fashioned cash register. It’s a 
personal computer (PC) connected to a receipt printer, cash drawer, 
credit/debit card reader and bar code scanner.

What can a POS system accomplish?

A good POS system achieves two goals. First, it makes the entire process of 
paying for an item simple and fast. This is achieved by scanning the item with 
the bar code scanner, (instead of keying in long numbers), getting the 
customer’s phone number (so you can tie each sale to an individual client) and 
totaling the purchase and accepting payment easily (the credit/debit card 
reader automatically dials the bank and gets approval in seconds). Furthermore, 
if the customer wants to "multiple tender", which means pay part of the bill 
with cash and part with a credit card, the task can be accomplished quickly and 
easily. A good POS system will also allow you to suspend a transaction which is 
invaluable for those times when a customer forgets their wallet in the car or 
has to run to the back of the store for something they forgot while two or 
three customers are waiting to check out. With transaction suspense, you can 
simply touch one key, take care of the other customers in line and when the 
first customer returns, retrieve the transaction and complete it without 
re-entering all the items.

The second goal of a POS system is to keep track of what your customers are 
buying and who they are. A good system will give you reports on what’s selling, 
at what times of the day or week, to which type of customer and by which sales 
people. A good POS will also allow you to have reminder dates for each customer 
so you can call or email them prior to an anniversary or birthday or any other 
event that they would appreciate that you track for them. Sales information by 
price point tells you what your customer will spend within a classification or 
event. Sales by vendor reports tell you which vendors are performing. The more 
information you can capture, the more efficiently you can control your business 
and your buying.

Why do I need a POS system?

Ten years ago it was probably possible to run a retail store without a 
computer. Today, it’s impossible. Your competition is using the POS information 
to better serve their customers and if you delay they will be using it to 
better serve your customers!

What's available on the market and how do I choose the system that's right 
for my store?

At last count, there were over 300 POS products on the market and this number 
grows almost daily. Choosing the right system amongst all these choices is not 
easy. I would suggest the following criteria for selecting a good system.

1.       Is the system used by at least 2,000 other (insert your store type 
here!)stores? You don’t want to be the guinea pig for a new system. You must to 
ensure you’re dealing with an experienced company that has sold the technology 
to other retailers, particularly retailers like you.

2.       Will the company give you the names and phone numbers of at least 10 
other  stores like yours that are using the software so you can call a fellow 
retailer No one will give you the real story about software or hardware except 
a fellow retailer. Make the call.

How much can I expect to pay?

The average price for a one-register store including all hardware, software, 
training, installation etc., is around $15,000. You can spend less, but you 
will get what you pay for. This is your future of your business, don’t try to 
cut corners. Buy good hardware that has on-site warranties, good training and 
lots of help. That $15,000 investment over five years is only $3,000 per year 
depreciated.  Don’t be confused by the low price of PC’s today and expect to 
pay a couple of hundred dollars for your POS equipment.  Quality costs money 
and you want the best hardware that you can get, you will save more in the long 
run with less down time and fewer service calls.  Also, a large part of your 
budget is for training and whatever you do, never skimp on training yourself 
and your staff on the system.

I'm not good with computers, how will I ever learn to work a POS system?

 Computers are still not as easy as cars to use. That fact has changed only 
slightly in the past 20 years. It will require you to learn a new skill. Is it 
that difficult? The answer is yes if you try to do it by yourself. The answer 
is no if you buy from a good company that offers training and instruction.

Do I need a different system for computerized inventory and for a customer 
database, or can I use the same one?

Only one is necessary. As a matter of fact, all of my comments up to now on 
POS system really meant a fully integrated system including inventory, purchase 
order and customer database controls. The good systems are fully integrated and 
one of the most important components is the customer database program which 
allows you to identify which customers purchased what items. These databases 
tie every SKU to a customer’s name and allow powerful queries/questions to be 
performed. A customer database can be used in limitless ways. For example, it 
can list all the customers who purchased a certain type of product, and send 
them an offering on a related item. Or it can send your 100 best gross margin 
customers a nice gift at Christmas, and send your lowest 50 gross margin 
customers a pre-clearance sale notice, as you know that sale merchandise 
appeals to them.  It can also track important dates for each customer and allow 
you to be pro active in reminding your customers of upcoming birthdays and 
anniversaries.

How does a POS system assist me with my buying?

It will tell you what you sold last year/season, which is a tremendous help 
when planning for the coming year. A good computer system can allow you to look 
at inventory on a daily basis, identify what items are not selling and focus 
attention on problem areas, identify hot items and confirm that there is enough 
stock on hand and on order to meet the demand. You will soon discover, however, 
that you will also need an additional piece of software called a spreadsheet 
(Lotus or Excel) to prepare your open-to-buy budgets.

Won't it be a lot of work to SKU all my products?

Yes it will. There is no way around it. If you sell by the SKU you have to 
buy by the SKU and make sure that every item in your store has a bar code. The 
good news is that many suppliers are starting to put UPC bar codes on their 
products and this saves us money by not having to put them on ourselves.

If my sales are only $200,000, is a POS system right for me?

If you want to stay at $200,000, then no you don’t need a POS system, just a 
funeral director who will wait a few years for you to arrive. Just kidding! 
Even at current sales of $200,000 the $3,000 a year investment that I talked 
about earlier is only one and a half percent of your sales. This percentage is 
what most retailers spend on technology today.

What if my staff doesn't want to learn how to use the system?

 Convince them that it will not only make the store better for customers, but 
will also make them more effective in serving customers.

How much will it cost me to train them?

Depends on the system and the person. Figure at least $500 per employee for 
basic training and up to $2,000 for complete full system training. Most of your 
employees will only need the basics and you can implement a ‘train the trainer’ 
format where you go and get the training and then give it to your staff. Also, 
look for companies that have good software manuals. This reduces training costs.

Can a POS system track internal theft?

It can track theft and inform you of how much you’re losing, but it can’t 
tell you who’s doing it. Only a video camera can do that. You also have to be 
careful of human error which can cause what appears to be theft, but are 
actually bookkeeping errors. For example, if you receive 36 items that are 
supposed to sell for $45 each and a price label falls off and it’s sold for 
$40, the system will report a $5 shrink. Human error accounts for over half of 
most stores’ shrinkage.

Are all POS systems the same? Can a system designed for a clothing store work 
in a hardware store?

No, one size does not fit all. It’s best to go with a software company that 
specializes in your type of store. The main reason is not that the clothing 
software won’t work for you (it probably will as clothing software is amongst 
the most complex due to size and color issues) but rather that any new 
developments in the software may not be built around your shop needs. You’ve 
heard the old cliché, "There is strength in numbers". This is especially true 
in software. The main customer base will be heard long before the few other 
stores that use the software.

Good luck. If you need more information, check out my Web site www.dionco.com

They Really Should Call It Point Of Service! 

Point of Sale, often referred to as POS should really be called Point of 
Service. In any company, if you really want to understand what is happening, 
look at where the money changes hands. All too often this critical moment that 
is the culmination of all our marketing, advertising, store design and layout, 
inventory management, assortment planning, in store signing, sales associate 
training, pricing and merchandise presentation is not a pleasant experience for 
our customers. In all the excitement of the threat of the new e-tailers it is 
becoming even more lost in the shuffle.

 Abandoned Baskets

As a matter of fact, one of the least talked about statistics on web sites 
are "abandoned baskets". Unless you are a grocery store, you may have never 
heard of this statistic. In a grocery store we look at how many customers came 
into the store, filled or partially filled a basket and then abandoned it 
before they reached the Point of Sale. Often, if this number of abandoned 
baskets is high it is a pretty strong indicator that our lineups were too long 
at POS and the customer got frustrated and left. Now, this is not the reason 
for every abandoned basket, some are due to genuine emergencies that customers 
have (such as forgetting their wallets!). The same statistic is tracked on the 
web. In this case, it is the measure of how many customers filled their 
shopping baskets and did not complete the order. In the case of the web, 
abandoned baskets are not felt to be caused by "long lines" but rather by 
sticker shock when the customer sees the delivered price after shipping and 
handling has been added. In supermarkets if you had ten percent abandoned 
baskets you would have a serious problem, on some web sites abandoned baskets 
can approach 30% or higher. Clearly showing a real problem with that Point of 
Sale.

Multi Channel vs Pure Play

Despite all the hype about web retail and virtual retailers the reality is 
that most business is still being done by "brick and mortar" retailers. For 
most categories, even in the next five years, web retail will not exceed 15% of 
total sales. What we are seeing is that the slow-to-web brick and mortar 
retailers are now beginning to adopt a multi channel approach. This approach is 
widely believed to be the one that will win more customers than pure virtual 
retail or pure brick and mortar. The multi channel approach is very simple, it 
is saying to the customer, "Any way that YOU want us to serve YOU, we will." 
This means that the customer can shop in our store, call us on the phone to 
order products, browse our catalogue (if we have one) and visit our web site to 
shop there. We are available in one way or another twenty four hours a day, 
seven days a week, 52 weeks a year.

Smart money is on the retail store brand names that customers recognize 
because they see them every day and are available for quick shopping trips when 
necessary and also available to deal with returns and adjustments. It has been 
noted that when the CLUMPS (Computer literate upwardly mobile professionals) no 
longer dominate web purchasing, as they do now, and middle America begins to 
trust and shop the web, that the majority of customers will choose stores that 
they are familiar with. Don’t you think that it will be more likely that a 
customer will remember Sears.com or Wal-Mart.com and not 
wehaveeverythingintheword.com?

Where It All Happens, Point of Service

As we noted in the beginning of this article, today we have to be where our 
customer wants us to be and provide the service that they require. There is 
probably no more demanding space than the last three feet in the store, when we 
consummate the transaction with the customer. Have you ever stood in a grocery 
store line, or a line at the Gap or Toys R Us? Most of us have, and what we 
notice is that most of the time the process moves relatively quickly. What we 
often fail to notice is that one of the reasons for this is the hardware that 
these companies use. POS hardware is often the most overlooked and under 
planned component in almost all independent retail businesses. Often the owner 
or manager selects a PC based POS system and then makes the mistake of 
believing that one computer is the same as another, and price becomes the 
determining factor.

So they go off and buy a low priced PC, often with the standard keyboard that 
comes with the machine (about a $10.00 part, by the way) and then add the 
cheapest receipt printer that they can buy (which also takes about five minutes 
to change/add new paper), a LED scanner that has to touch the bar code to read 
it, and add a cash drawer. Then, when confronted with the credit card dilemma, 
often opt for a free standing credit card approval box that is separate from 
their PC system. Is it any wonder that after a few months the keyboard begins 
to stick, the scanner no longer works, the credit card machine falls off the 
counter, the printer jams or produces receipts that are all but unreadable?

Sleeping with the Enemy

I have always found it fascinating that many retailers turn into just the 
type of customer that they themselves do not want in their own stores. A 
customer that is not interested in quality or service, just price. I call it 
"sleeping with the enemy." As retailers we try to impress upon our customers 
the folly of trying to get something for nothing, and the lesson that quality 
and functionality do not come cheap. How often have you wanted to grab a 
customer, shake them and tell them that you can’t pay $12.00 for an item and 
expect it to perform and last like a $50.00 item?

Our POS hardware should be the last thing that we have to worry about in our 
store. It should be rock solid, easy to repair (this means that service and 
parts are easy to come by), fast and durable. You don’t get all this by paying 
the lowest price! Receipt printers should be ultra fast and today, thermal is 
often the way to go. Scanners should be laser and be able to read a bar code 
from at least six inches away, keyboards should be heavy duty and have a built 
in card swipe for credit cards. Many retailers are also not providing customer 
pole displays and this is often a mistake. Today, customers are very interested 
in what items are scanning at, and a customer display is a great service to the 
customer. How many of us have to wait to read the receipt to know that we were 
charged the wrong price?

A great POS system can add a substantial amount of money to a retailers 
bottom line. By reducing the time for customer check out, we can sell more 
customers with less staff time and in high transaction environments, even with 
fewer lanes. Additional benefits will also come from fewer items mis rung, 
lower maintenance and repair costs, less down time, faster inventory turnover 
and better replenishment of sold merchandise. A study that we did a few years 
ago demonstrated that automated POS increased profitability by over 25% in a 
gift store.

Point of sale is where it all takes place in a store. If I can’t quickly and 
efficiently collect the sales dollars from my customers, they will go 
elsewhere. Have you ever wondered why the major retailers have those great big, 
heavy-duty cash registers at point of sale? You might figure that they could 
just get away with a low price PC and cash drawer. What the big retailers have 
discovered is that well made POS equipment and software pays for itself in a 
very short period of time. They seldom have any bottlenecks at point of sale 
and their hardware and software stands up to very tough use. This quality and 
reliability costs money. A good PC and cash drawer configuration is only about 
50% more expensive than the low price models, but the peace of mind and service 
to the customer is always worth much more.

Recognize that quality costs money and training takes time and money. We 
often do not ever compute the cost of all the breakdowns on the cheap products 
and the extra time spent self teaching ourselves the wrong way to do something 
on our machines. If we spent a little more for hardware, software and training 
we would be amazed at how much productivity we would gain. Expect to pay up to 
five to eight times the price of software to learn how to use it properly and 
up to 50% higher for better quality hardware. Then you can and will get huge 
increases in productivity that will more than pay for this small investment.

New POS machines are also making it easier to set up and change peripherals. 
The new USB ports are making it very easy to add not only receipt printers, but 
also report printers, scanners, scales, customer pole displays, cash drawers 
and other devices that we may need to change quickly. A good rule of thumb for 
POS is that it should be easy for our staff to learn and use and fast and 
almost transparent for our customers.

Retail Site Selection Mapping

Maptitude  makes it easy to use maps to 
analyze and understand the best locations for retail site selection, hotel site 
selection, or any other facility placement problem. Maptitude is a powerful 
combination of site mapping software and geographic data that provides 
everything that you need to make informed decisions.

In addition to the latest demographics, Maptitude includes substantial 
social, housing, and income data, along with easy-to-use analysis tools that 
will allow you to better understand the relationships between your demand, 
supply, and competitor locations.(Figure 1) 

In addition to the site selection tools below, Maptitude has extensive 
functionality for Marketing and Sales Mapping 
 including 
travel time rings.

Site Location Analysis:

With Maptitude you can create a circular service area that encompasses a set 
of points such as addresses. You can then choose to weight the center location 
by a field in your point layer such as demand (Figure 2).

 For example, if you are considering relocating a store, you can create a 
trade area around your customers and weight the center by their sales volume to 
determine a new candidate location. Alternatively, you may have a database of 
client employees. You can then use Maptitude to see the best central location 
based on the density and distribution of the addresses. These could be weighted 
by seniority, allowing you to better explore potential site locations by 
considering staff characteristics.

Facility Location Analysis:

 Facility  location problems involve choosing the best location for one or 
more facilities from a set of possible locations (Figure 3). These tools are 
available at additional cost. Please contact Caliper Sales at +1 617-527-4700 or
 Sales@caliper.com  for more information.

This toolset can address virtually all types of location problem. Potential 
applications include exploring new franchise locations, corporate office 
relocations, and branch optimization. For example:


 * You want to determine the number of facilities that are required to 
guarantee a certain level of service. 
 * You may also need to account for financial or operational constraints, such 
as a maximum number of facilities you are able to add, or a fixed budget for 
adding facilities. 
 * Revenues and profits depend on the choice of facility locations. In these 
cases, you need to balance the cost of adding a facility with the potential 
revenue benefit. 
 * You want to maximize the distance between facilities and the population 
they serve. For example, to minimize proximity to a competitor. Landfills and 
power plants are also often located relatively far from major population 
centers. 
 * You want to consider the presence of existing facilities. The locations of 
these facilities obviously affect the choice of locations for new facilities. 
In addition, you may want to consider both adding new facilities and closing 
one or more existing facilities.

CipherLab's Intelligent Order Entry Software Solves Retail and Grocery 
Shipping Problems

Proactively suggest adding or removing items to properly and completely fill 
a container, helping our members minimize their shipping costs.


 *       IOE program on CipherLab 
Mobile Computers

Intelligent Order Entry can also assist grocers and retailers to more 
efficiently deliver goods by air, sea and rail. (PRWEB) July 30, 2012 

 CipherLab, a leading innovator in Automated Identification and Data Capture 
(AIDC) for the retail, warehouse and distribution markets, today announced the 
availability of automatic container space calculation software for use on its 
industrial mobile computers. CipherLab's Intelligent Order Entry (IOE), 
designed specifically for use by grocery and C-stores, ensures that shipping 
container space is maximized to resolve packing problems and reduce overall 
freight costs. When used in conjunction with CipherLab's handheld scanners, 
Intelligent Order Entry enables users to calculate the cubic footage and weight 
of bulk goods, thereby reducing wasted space in shipping containers. The IOE 
program also alerts users to discontinued items, the availability of substitute 
items, converts UPC codes to warehouse codes and displays backroom inventory 
during the order process.

IOE program user have a streamlined and efficient logistics system that takes 
into account the unique needs of maritime transportation. In this business, 
weight is not necessarily the biggest cost factor - it's space. By working with 
CipherLab IOE program, users put ordering control into its customers' hands. 
Now, customers know exactly how much container space will be required for each 
order. This enables us to proactively suggest adding or removing items to 
properly and completely fill a container, helping our members minimize their 
shipping costs."

The new Intelligent Order Entry can also assist grocers and retailers to more 
efficiently deliver goods by air, sea and rail. Although it is initially 
developed for use in port facilities, the concept of "cubing," or automatically 
calculating the cubic feet of container space, is the same for other forms of 
transportation. The bottom line is that Intelligent Order Entry, when coupled 
with CipherLab handheld mobile computers, creates one of the most efficient 
systems of its type - and one that gives an almost immediate return on 
investment to customers.

Entry program or other CipherLab products, please visithttp://www.cipherlab.com

is ready, we go hands-on  HD

 It's been a long time coming, and now the Android-powered, Kickstarter-funded
OUYA  video game console is finally heading 
to backers. Sure, the final retail units for non-backers won't be available
until June 

, but around 50,000 lucky folks who pledged over $99 to OUYA's massively 
successful campaign will be receiving their units in the coming days. We've 
already heardwhat developers have to say 
 about it, but 
this week we got our first hands-on with the miniature, Tegra 3-powered game 
console we've been hearing so much about since last summer.

 Is it the "best Tegra 3 device on the market," as OUYA's claimed 
? Let's find out!

 Hardware



 Our first-blush impressions of the gamepad, unpaired from the console, are 
mostly positive. The controller has a good heft to it, doesn't feel cheap and 
the buttons / analog sticks are appropriately clicky and maneuverable. The only 
real issues are the shoulder buttons and triggers, which both look and feel 
cheap -- the triggers were actually a sticking point for OUYA with the 
development kit that launched last December, and it seems the company's still 
got some kinks to iron out there.

 The faceplate on each side of the controller's face detaches, which is where 
you replace the two AA batteries that power it. OUYA also says it'll offer 
customizable faceplates, but, well, we're just not that excited by the 
prospect. Additionally, since it's simply a Bluetooth controller, the OUYA 
gamepad can be used on any Bluetooth-compatible device; to that same end, any 
Bluetooth-enabled controller works wirelessly with OUYA (so, Sony's DualShock 
3, for instance, but not Microsoft's Xbox 360 gamepad -- you'd have to plug in 
a wired 360 gamepad via USB).



 The console itself is incredibly small. It's less than half the size of the 
gamepad, actually. What it lacks in size, however, it makes up for in density. 
The OUYA is a heavy little box, intentionally weighted to support the various 
cables you'll plug into its rear to hook it up to your television. It's also 
incredibly quiet -- with no discs to spin and a fan that rarely kicks up dust, 
the OUYA runs whisper-quiet. Beyond just quiet and heavy, though, the OUYA is a 
pretty little thing. The brushed aluminum on its four sides looks sharp, and 
the tinted, glossy plastic up top gives the console a quality look. Hiding the 
fan on the bottom is another nice touch -- Jawbone Jambox designerYves Béhar 
 sculpted a final product that both 
stands out and subtly fits into existing media centers.

 Software

 OUYA's software UI is, to put it lightly, very sparse. Just four submenus 
branch from the main dashboard: Play, Discover, Make and Manage. The Manage 
menu is little more than a way to directly access the hidden Android settings 
-- it brings up a standard Android settings menu, which we're told will be 
swapped for a custom screen in the future -- so let's put that aside for now. 
Play acts as your content manager, where both games and applications that 
you've downloaded reside. It's essentially a file dump, organized into visual 
tiles -- not thrilling, but certainly serviceable for current purposes. 
Discover is perhaps the most interesting of the areas -- it's a stand-in for 
"place where you purchase content" -- and it's a curated store helmed by recent 
hire Kellee Santiago. Not only does it allow for various categorical 
organization and featured games, but it also enables popular games to bubble up 
naturally via thumbs-up icons that users can employ for each game. Make is 
another unique twist, offering a section for devs to upload builds of their 
games for all to play; call it a glorified beta section, but its promise is 
what excites us most. Not only can devs upload and crowdtest their games, but 
players can test out their own builds on the fly through sideloading.



 Troubling, however, is the noticeable lag between the game controller and 
the OUYA. From games to UI, the lag was a noticeable issue -- other journalists 
we spoke with encountered the same issue. It's not something that's impossible 
to fix, of course. Even Nintendo's speeding up its Wii U software issuesin an 
upcoming patch , so 
it wouldn't be a huge surprise to see OUYA correcting the lag issue before 
June's retail launch.

 It's also hard to fault what is -- for now -- a niggling issue with a $100 
game console that went from Kickstarter to available in around 10 months. The 
promise of the console is far more appealing, and the time we've spent with the 
OUYA has us even more excited for its unknown future.

Apple Monday fired the two top executives in charge of its mobile software 
and retail operations in a move that the company said is aimed at making the 
company's divisions all work better together.

It's also another reminder that late CEO Steve Jobs is gone and Tim Cook is 
working to remold the company in a more modern mode as it moves forward. Cook 
said Scott Forstall, who heads mobile software, and retail chief John Browett 
are leaving

Forstall, an Apple veteran is the biggest executive packing up his desk. For 
many years, Forstall ran software development for the iPad and iPhone and many 
felt he most closely embodied Jobs' technology ideas.

However, Forstall's ambitious nature generated friction in the company, even 
more so after Jobs died, reports theNew York Times 

, and the problems with mobile maps in the new Apple operating system sealed 
his doom.

Remember back a month ago, when Cook sent out a letter 

 to customers admitting to the problem? You know, the one where he sounded like 
he was groveling and where he said people can always use other map apps until 
Apple worked out the bugs?

Instead of security escorting Scott Forstall out, they made him use Maps to 
locate the front door. He ended up trapped in a broom closet.

— Michael Simmons (@macguitar) October 30, 2012 




Well, it seems Forstall was the one who should have apologized for the 
matter, but he refused to sign a public apology, leaving it up to his boss. He 
also dismissed the problems as being exaggerated, said a source who declined to 
be named. His stance mirrored what Jobs did back when the antennae would not 
work on a previous iPhone, and the late CEO implied the problem was mainly user 
error.

Meanwhile, Browett, who joined Apple this year, left his post as CEO of 
Dixons Retail, the largest U.K. consumer-electronics retailer. Apple had 
searched for more than seven months for someone to replace Ron Johnson, who 
left to head J.C. Penney.

Apple is calling some of Browett's steps, including reducing staffing at it 
stores and cutting people's hours a "mistake" and said it's looking for a new 
head of retail. Meanwhile, the retail team will report directly to Cook until a 
new senior vice president can be found.

Forstall, though, as an Apple veteran who often took the stage during product 
launches, was the biggest shocker in Monday's announcements.

His duties will be taken over by Jonathan "Jony" Ive, Eddy Cue and Craig 
Federighi.

Cue will be in charge of Apple maps and Siri, the iPhone's virtual assistant, 
both of which have been criticized for not meeting Apple's usual quality 
standards.

Ive, the head of industrial design who's even been knighted for his 
expertise, will get more software responsibilities, and Federighi will lead 
development of iOS, the operating system for Apple's products.

In another part of the shakeup, Bob Mansfield, who had run hardware 
engineering and was planning to retire, is getting his own division, 
Technologies, which will combine the company's wireless and semiconductor 
teams. Mansfield, who until now had nobody reporting to him, had been exploring 
health apps for Apple's mobile products.

Some industry insiders said Forstall was a strong proponent in user 
interfaces, or skeuomorphic design, which imitates artifacts and textures. Jobs 
was a big fan of the design program, but Ive thought they looked dated.

It didn't help Forstall's case to be on the outs with Ive and many other top 
executives. Insiders said Ive and Forstall wouldn't even be in the same meeting 
room together. Apparently, Forstall was fighting with other executives as well 
over design issues.

 Abstract

IT is evolving rapidly, and the retail industry is looking at how it can 
improve business. Retailers are facing the challenge of how best to meet the 
need of an increasingly demanding customer base, while reducing the overall 
costs. In addition to meeting customer demands, retailers are facing the 
challenges of integrating their various functionalities and channels, which are 
mostly run as silos.

One of the emerging trends in the technology space is something known as 
Software as a Service (SaaS). This paper provides an overview of different 
architectures, their pros and cons, and the key technologies that are 
reinventing the centralized architecture now known as Software as a Service.

 Introduction

The retail industry is known to lag behind other industries in adopting new 
technology. One of the major reasons is the razor-thin margins with which 
retailers work, which demand the quick return on investment (ROI) that are 
usually granted only by established technologies and methodologies

Looking back, the evolution of retail architecture has thus followed what 
happened in other industrial sectors, moving from mainframe-based centralized 
architecture towards a departmental architecture where mini and personal 
computers brought data processing inside the stores. However, this shift 
created the new problem of data exchange with corporate systems. The evolution 
continued with client-server and then distributed architectures and now is 
evolving towards service-oriented architecture (SOA). Also, new concepts like
Software as a Service (SaaS) 
, which are 
achieving considerable success in the customer-relations management (CRM) 
sector, are not present yet in the store applications; but the situation is 
changing. This paper will provide an overview of SaaS and applicable 
technologies and their benefits to the retail industry.

 Business Challenges

Retail presents some peculiar challenges. Inside the store, there are two 
very distinct software functions: the store front, which is the "public" part 
devoted to check out that accesses data on products, customers, promotions, and 
so on; and the store back-office or "private" part of the store systems, for 
stock management, replenishment, reporting, labor scheduling, and inventory 
management. In some really small-footprint stores, both functions are carried 
out on the same physical computer, but they remain very distinct in nature.

 

Figure 1. Retail store with front-end and back-office applications (Click on 
the picture for a larger image)

 Point-of-Sale Transactions

In retail, the point-of-sale (POS) transactions are extremely important, yet 
have unique issues when compared to similar transactions in the B2B world. An 
obvious question is: Why is the problem of a delay in issuing a small valued 
ticket (due to a hardware or software failure, or just slow response time) so 
critical? The same problem for higher-valued invoices in a B2B transaction 
creates a limited problem, to the extent that it is not even noticed. The 
reason for this is twofold:


 * Stores make their profits from a high number of low-value transactions, 
usually concentrated in part of the day or part of the week and the check-out 
operations cannot be delayed during these times. 
 * A POS interruption, even for a limited time, may cause not only significant 
economic losses but, even more important, losses of customers gained with 
expensive and long effort. The bottom line is that POS is more mission-critical 
than the back office. POS must function at all times, irrespective of 
connectivity in the store, whereas back-office functions can wait for the 
connectivity to comeback. It also points to the possibility of back-office 
functions running either inside the store or provided by a service providers 
over the Internet.

 The Distributed vs. Centralized Architecture Dilemma

Outside the store, there are many centralized activities, such as logistics, 
marketing, bookkeeping, and so on. The efficiency of the retail activity 
depends on quantity and quality of data flow inside and outside the store. 
Software architectural choices are very important and difficult, because 
reliability and data sharing are conflicting factors.

Traditionally, POS systems are autonomous systems that exchange flat files in 
batch mode with back-office systems for stock management and reporting. In the 
same offline mode and after a role change, the back-office system exchanges 
sales and item data with corporate systems and other partners. This is defined 
asdistributed architecture where operations are supported by a local database, 
so that no external failure can stop such vital operations.

The distributed architecture has a reliability and scalability advantage 
because it has no single point of failure and processing is distributed, but 
requires a complex synchronization activity among autonomous systems with their 
own databases and an expensive deployment. Store-sales information must be 
uploaded to the corporate systems and item and promotion information must be 
downloaded to the store systems. In addition, deployment of new applications, 
patches, and updates is not easy. There is also the issue of monitoring systems 
at the stores to ensure that the critical systems are functioning normally at 
all times.

 

Figure 2. Distributed architecture (Click on the picture for a larger image)

In the centralized architecture, the store front-end systems (POS terminals, 
self service kiosks, and so forth) are connected online to the store server 
over a network and exchange sales information in real time. In the same way, 
the store back-office systems can be connected online to the corporate systems 
for exchanging sales and item information. Permanent connection over a network 
makes richer data available, such as a customer's previous transactions, 
specific promotions, real-time loyalty-points management, stock availability, 
and next delivery date.

A centralized architecture with a single database solves the synchronization 
problem, but introduces a single point of failure and scalability limit, both 
inside the store for POS management and outside for connection to corporate 
systems. The central server failure or a network failure stops the business 
completely, with very serious consequences.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to achieve the advantages of the 
distributed architecture (such as reliability and scalability) without the 
burden of database synchronization. Many organizations that need services given 
only by an online access to centralized data, being on the store or in the HQ, 
use redundant servers and connections or emergency operations, but at higher 
costs and complexity.

When data exchanges among autonomous and heterogeneous systems are performed 
through flat files, eventually with some "impedance-mismatch" problems or even 
with some data loss, the architecture is defined asdepartmental.

When the data exchange among subsystems is performed by design with maximum 
fidelity, no data loss, and automatic updates, the architecture is defined as
distributed. Sometimes, the term "distributed architecture" is used for "grid 
computing," the sharing of resources through a network of generic computers 
arranged to create a virtual super computer. In our case, the term 
"distributed" is used just to emphasize a high integration level among 
subsystems obtained at the application level, and not at the operating system 
level.

Only recently have the big enterprise resource planning (ERP) players offered 
vertical solutions for retail—always deriving from acquisitions and after some 
efforts on user interface (UI), business rules, and data integration. The 
majority of retail systems in use today are situated in the spectrum from 
departmental to distributed architectures, with a gradual migration from the 
first to the second.

 

Figure 3. Centralized architecture (Click on the picture for a larger image)

 Client-Server Architecture

In the client-server architecture—as the name implies—the client asks for 
some service, which the server will fulfill. The client-server architecture 
represented an improvement over centralized architecture, because presentation 
and user-interaction functions are transferred from the server to the 
client—normally, on a PC with a processing power much higher than the old green 
terminals. This reduces the load on the server and leads to an improved system 
scalability and responsiveness to the user. However, it does not solve the 
"single-point-of-failure" issue.

In the retail industry, the client-server architecture is used more often 
inside the store—connecting POS to the back of the store—and less outside using 
a unique centralized server for an entire chain of stores.

 Centralized-Architecture Revival

With the increasing availability of high-speed Internet connections, 
centralized architecture is gaining new life, not with old mainframes and green 
screens, but with modern and rich graphical user experience through Windows 
Terminal Server from Microsoft, similar products from Citrix, or browser-based 
applications. Also client-server applications, which depend heavily on the 
connectivity, received a huge boost due to the widespread availability of 
virtual private networks (VPN).

The application software providers (ASP) of 10 years ago were based on a 
centralized architecture in which data, business logic, presentation, and user 
interfaces resided in a data center—leaving in-store personal computers 
underutilized.

ASPs offered solutions that provided following advantages: 


 * No upfront licensing costs 
 * No deployment hassles 
 * Can be accessed from anywhere 
 * Promised around-the-clock availability However, some of these promises did 
not really materialize, such as the around-the-clock availability, as there 
were outages at the ASPs. The user experience suffered also from bad response 
time when the low scalability of the architecture added up with Internet 
latency. Therefore, the first generation of ASP solutions did not achieve much 
success, due to their limited improvements, compared to traditional software. 
The correct way would have been to redesign the applications for providing 
service over the Internet, which requires completely different thinking.

In the retail industry, the success of ASP-based solutions was even lower, 
because the mission-critical nature of POS operations demands availability of 
service and local data even during the loss of connectivity. In other words, 
offline operations are critical in retail from both business and psychological 
points of view.

 Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Real-time connectivity among store systems, corporate systems, supplier 
systems, logistics, and other service providers through the Internet is a great 
condition that all retailers strive for. Extensive research has been devoted to 
overcome the limitations of terminal- or browser-based solutions.

AJAX and other rich Internet application (RIA) technologies are an answer to 
real-time connectivity and responsiveness. However, they are not a solution for 
a POS where only a local application with a local database can provide the 
necessary functionality and availability.

To meet this need, there is a new model—based on XML and Web services—that is 
delivering rich services from an array of heterogeneous applications in a 
distributed architecture. Service orientation (SO) is the natural evolution of 
current development models. The 1980s saw the object-oriented models; then, 
there was the component-based development model in the 1990s; and, now, we have 
service orientation. Service orientation retains the benefits of 
component-based development (self-description, encapsulation, dynamic 
discovery, and loading), but there is a shift in paradigm from remotely 
invoking methods on objects, to one of passing messages among services. Schemas 
describe not only the structure of messages, but also behavioral contracts to 
define acceptable message-exchange patterns and policies to define service 
semantics. This promotes interoperability and, thus, provides adaptability 
benefits, as messages can be sent from one service to another without 
considering how the service handling those messages has been implemented.

 

Figure 4. SOA architecture (Click on the picture for a larger image)

Service orientation provides an evolutionary approach to building distributed 
software that facilitates loosely coupled integration with its inherent 
scalability and resilience. With the advent of the WS-* specifications, Web 
services architecture has made service-oriented software development feasible 
by virtue of mainstream development tools support and broad industry 
interoperability. Although most frequently implemented using industry-standard 
Web services, service orientation is independent of technology and its 
architectural patterns, and can be used to connect with legacy systems, too.

Unfortunately, the benefits offered by service orientation and SOA have been 
obscured by the hype and confusion that increasingly surround the terms. As 
awareness and excitement around SOA have swelled, the clear lines that once 
defined service orientation have been blurred. However SO does offer some 
specific benefits when used for the right purpose.

To increase SOA systems scalability, the service should be as stateless as 
possible. Not having to lookup the client's state from the previous interaction 
conserves CPU resources. In addition, the coupling between service users and 
providers should be as loose as possible or, in other words, asynchronous. 
Compared to traditional client-server architectures (in which each client waits 
idly for its turn to be served), in SOA architectures, the client usually 
switches to other tasks while waiting for the answer.

 Smart Client

When an application exhibits the following properties, it is called a smart 
client and has the following characteristics: 


 * Utilizes local resources (CPU, GPU, and so on) 
 * Consumes Web services 
 * Operates online/offline where appropriate 
 * Intelligent deployment/update 

Figure 5. Smart-client properties

Close examination of these characteristics reveals that these are the same 
requirements as a POS application.

On the other side, as store's back-office functions are less critical and 
can, therefore, be designed to work only when connected to the centralized 
systems, a rich AJAX-based client can be a good choice. But, especially with 
complex applications, there are many benefits of smart clients. They marry the 
best of the Web with the best of Windows, lower operation and development costs 
(especially when offline capabilities are limited), increase user experience 
and satisfaction, and align with future technology. Moreover, they can be 
easily deployed with ClickOnce, where the cost is as low as browser-based 
solutions.

 Software as a Service

Service orientation brings many benefits with it in building agile, 
configurable, and scalable services. The loosely coupled benefit of SO helps in 
building a centralized service that can be easily configured, can scale based 
on the use, and can support multitenancy.

When a service is being built to support many customer needs, it is best to 
consider building it as configurable and scalable service that uses metadata to 
provide different experiences to customers. A centralized service that can 
support many customers with different requirements through metadata-based 
configuration is defined "multitenant" and offers the best ROI, because it can 
provide different experiences to different customers through configuration, 
reducing the cost of infrastructure. Using a housing metaphor, a multitenant 
system is comparable to a block where a number of different flats share land, 
stairs, roof, and so on.

A single instance of service that can serve multiple customers over the 
Internet is now known as Software as a Service (SaaS) and can be broadly 
defined as "software deployed as a hosted service and accessed over the 
Internet." SaaS is going to have a major impact on the software industry, 
because it will change the way in which people build, sell, buy, and use 
software. For this to happen, however, software vendors need resources and 
information about developing SaaS applications effectively.

SaaS as a concept is often associated with the ASPs of the 1990s, which 
provided "shrink-wrap" applications to business users over the Internet. As 
mentioned previously, in some ways, these early attempts at Internet-delivered 
software had more in common with traditional on-premise applications than with 
modern SaaS applications, such as licensing and architecture. Because these 
applications were originally built as single-tenant applications, their ability 
to share data and processes with other applications was limited, and they 
tended to offer few economic benefits over their locally installed 
counterparts. Today, SaaS applications are expected to take advantage of the 
benefits of centralization through a single-instance, multitenant architecture, 
and to provide a feature-rich experience competitive with comparable on-premise 
applications. A typical SaaS application is offered either directly by the 
vendor or by an intermediary party called an aggregator, which bundles SaaS 
offerings from different vendors and offers them as part of a unified 
application platform.

On the technical side, the SaaS provider hosts the application and data 
centrally—deploying patches and upgrades to the application transparently, and 
delivering access to end users over the Internet through a browser or 
smart-client application. Many vendors provide application programming 
interfaces (API) that expose the applications' data and functionality to 
developers for use in creating composite applications. A variety of security 
mechanisms can be used to keep sensitive data safe in transmission and storage. 
Applications providers might provide tools that allow customers to modify the 
data schema, workflow, and other aspects of the application's operation for 
their use. Figure 6 shows a sample SaaS architecture.



Figure 6. Sample SaaS architecture

SaaS can include a number of services and applications that are not commonly 
expected to be found in this category. For example, consider Web-based e-mail 
services, such as Microsoft Hotmail. Although Hotmail might not be the first 
example that comes to mind when you think of SaaS, it meets all of the basic 
criteria: A vendor hosts all of the program logic and data, and provides end 
users with access to this data over the public Internet, through a Web-based 
user interface.

Moving from the general to specific, we can identify two major categories of 
SaaS:


 * Line-of-business services (LOB) offered to enterprises and organizations of 
all sizes—LOB services are often large, customizable business solutions aimed 
at facilitating business processes, such as finances, supply-chain management, 
and customer relations. Typically, these services are sold to customers on a 
subscription basis. 
 * Consumer-oriented services offered to the general public—Consumer-oriented 
services are sometimes sold on a subscription basis, but often are provided to 
consumers at no cost, and are supported by advertising. In retail, there are 
many opportunities in the LOB category, such as back-office 
inventory-management applications, payment-processing applications, reporting 
services, and so on. We cover this in more depth in the following section.

SaaS Benefits in Retail

SOA and SaaS concepts allow important cost reductions to better serve 
existing markets and open entirely new ones. With his article "The Long Tail," 
in the October 2004 issue ofWired (see the References 
 
section), Chris Anderson popularized the idea of the "long tail" in explaining 
why online retailers such as Amazon.com are uniquely positioned to fill a huge 
demand that traditional retailers cannot serve cost-effectively.

Retail follows the famous 80/20 rule: The most popular merchandise (which is 
usually 20 percent) is bought by 80 percent of the customers. So, retailers are 
forced to decide whether to carry the remaining 80 percent of non-popular 
merchandise in the store or carry more of the popular merchandise. The 
traditional "brick-and-mortar" retailers concentrate on selling the more 
popular items, because they cannot possibly stock non-popular merchandise. 
Online retailers, however, do not have to worry about limited shelf space. 
Shipping items to customers directly from large warehouses around the world, 
they can advertise and sell the millionth most popular title as easily as the 
most popular one. Access to this long tail of low-volume sales translates into 
a huge amount of revenue.

So, what does this have to do with SaaS? Retailers face several challenges 
when they evaluate software to run their businesses:


 * Upfront investment—The cost of the central system is usually not directly 
proportional to the number of stores, weighing more on small or new chains. 
 * Deployment cost—Traditional software must be installed and maintained by 
competent technicians traveling from store to store with high cost and limited 
peak capacity. Also, remote maintenance over the Internet is usually done one 
store at a time. 
 * Technical competence—Successful retailers are usually more competent on 
customer needs and products/services than on IT operations. 
 * Data-sharing difficulties—It is quite easy to share data with HQ, but 
complex to do with third parties—such as independent logistics, product 
catalogues, and market analysis—or when exchanging customer data with other 
non-competing chains for joint-loyalty programs. 
 * Cost of new software-feature implementation—The new feature, even if 
already available, must be bought and deployed over some test stores. If 
acceptable, the general deployment cannot be immediate. What SaaS offers is an 
opportunity to provide customized services to many small customers using a 
single platform, which cannot be accomplished through traditional means. A 
widely known example of SaaS is SalesForce.Com, which is able to offer CRM 
capabilities to many customers over the Internet using a single system. This 
ability to offer functionality to multiple tenants is the biggest advantage of 
SaaS.

There are many other areas in which retailers can benefit from SaaS 
applications. For example, a retail enterprise, switching from old systems to a 
SaaS POS integrated with their ERP, allows the implementation of very 
sophisticated and new fidelity initiatives, so they can securely share data 
with other non-competing chains through centralized retail Web services. New 
features can be tried and adopted only when they fit the business model and the 
customer composition, without any spike in internal IT effort or risk. Because 
of this, with SaaS, an independent store can use the same software as the large 
enterprise retailer—eventually, using it in more creative and effective ways.

There is one key difference in the process of how traditional software is 
sold, deployed, and used compared to SaaS-based applications. Selling SaaS is 
like selling mobile-phone ringtones or downloadable music: It should be 
possible for a customer to visit a SaaS provider's site, subscribe to the 
service, pay with a credit card, customize the service, and begin using it—all 
without human intervention on the part of the service provider. This does not 
mean that a more personal approach is completely eliminated. It can still be 
used for larger retailers with more extensive needs. But designing the sales, 
marketing, provisioning, and customization processes from the ground up to work 
automatically makes it possible to offer an automated approach as a choice; 
also, it has the happy side effect of simplifying the work that the support 
personnel of the service provider must perform to accomplish the same tasks on 
behalf of a customer.

Figure 7 shows the SaaS maturity model as mentioned in the SaaS paper (see the
References 
 
section). According to this model, as soon as the services architecture is 
achieved, some of the services can be outsourced to a SaaS-based service 
provider over the Internet. In this retail-based example, the fourth model 
shows that the end-user application is composed of services—some of which are 
hosted internally and some of which are provided by the SaaS-based service 
provider. This composition layer can be realized using either an AJAX-based 
thin client or a smart client. The selection should be based on the business 
function and requirements for up time.

 

Figure 7. SaaS maturity model (Click on the picture for a larger image)

If a retailer decides to use SaaS-based POS, the best option is to be 
smart-client–based, which can be easily deployed over the Internet. Local 
databases must be synchronized, but the effort is paid back with increased 
reliability and scalability.

Compared to traditional offline POS, a smart-client–based one exploits fully 
the online connectivity to central resources offering additional services and 
work offline only when connectivity is temporarily lost—and, therefore, will 
not upset the delicate POS transactions, as customers will not be affected if 
the service goes offline, whereas a traditional offline POS performs always in 
the lowest mode.

In retail, the availability demand for back-office applications is lower than 
for front-office and, thus, can be based on Web 2.0 technologies, such as AJAX 
and Windows Presentation Foundation/Everywhere (WPF/E); but, for complex 
applications, a smart client offers a more robust and optimized development 
environment.

 Key Microsoft Technologies

Key Microsoft technologies that help in realizing this architecture start 
with Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and 
Windows Workflow Foundation (WF). These two key components of .NET Framework 
3.0 help in creating Web services and workflows to realize this architecture. 
.NET Framework 3.0 is released, and it is available on both the Windows Vista 
and Microsoft Windows XP platforms.

Some of the other technologies are highlighted in this section.

ClickOnce

ClickOnce is a technology for application delivery and maintenance over the 
Internet in a simple and secure way. The application package can be published 
on a Web site and installed through a Web page. A ClickOnce application can 
operate on the workstation in isolated mode, protecting it from incompatibility 
and reliability problems that may arise when a new application is installed on 
an already working system.

Initial installation and subsequent updates happen only after verification of 
the software maker and without administrative credentials from the user, 
increasing the trust and acceptance of this technology. These and other 
features reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO) for the user and allow the 
developer to distribute the smart-client application to thousands of 
workstations with small effort.

SQL Server 2005

Central Web services and local smart clients are based on the Microsoft SQL 
Server family of databases. SQL Server 2005 is used on the central retail Web 
services where native XML data management is very useful, along with advanced 
maintenance and storage services. SQL Server Express is used on smart clients, 
because it is equally feature-rich, but lighter and installable through 
ClickOnce.

Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)

WCF is the new unified programming model for communications. It has complete 
flexibility of:


 * Transport. 
 * Encoding. 
 * Message-exchange pattern. 
 * Security. WCF provides a unified software layer for exchanging data with 
every standard platform and in any condition. Security is very important, and 
WCF assures integrity and confidentiality of data exchanged with the retail Web 
services. WCF also increases the reliability and efficiency of the available 
channel.

 

Figure 8. WCF architecture (Click on the picture for a larger image)

Store back-office applications can be linked to the retail Web services 
through a WCF HTTP channel supporting WS-* specifications, to make it 
interoperable with non-Windows applications. Alternatively, WCF makes available 
a high-performance channel based on TCP—fully exploiting improvements in the 
.NET Framework 3.0. Store back-office applications can automatically select the 
best protocol for the available channel; and, inside the store, WCF allows a 
peer-to-peer cooperation among the workstations.

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

Another power technology is the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). WPF is 
the new user-experience platform, and is part of .NET Framework 3.0 for 
building highly interactive and sophisticated user interfaces that provided a 
rich experience to users that was previously difficult with Windows Forms.

 

Figure 9. WPF architecture (Click on the picture for a larger image)

WPF solves this difficult problem and makes it very easy to build graphically 
rich user experiences for skilled and unskilled users. Also, with WPF, it is 
possible for the first time for interaction designers and programmers to 
cooperate using the new language, known as Extensible Application Markup 
Language (XAML, pronounced "zammel"). XAML is a declarative XML-based language 
that is used to define objects and their properties, relationships, and 
interactions. XAML is used also as a user-interface markup language to define 
UI elements, data binding, eventing, and other features, as well as in WF, in 
which workflows themselves can be defined using XAML.

 Conclusion

The IT industry is going through a major change and technology is enabling 
this disruption. The lowering cost of bandwidth, the availability of computing 
in new and cheaper forms factors and devices, and the increases in productivity 
and usability have caused a massive growth in services over the Internet. The 
retail industry, which operates on razor-thin margins, can certainly take 
advantage of these services to reduce overall cost and enhance services. 
Microsoft technologies play a key role in enabling retailers to take advantage 
of this new paradigm.

If your company is using Tyler Retail Software, then you may have questions, 
problems or concerns.

Good News – We Can Help. 

We have over 10 years experience working with Tyler software. Our Tyler 
experience first began back in 1999 when Pauleen Miller, the founder of Rock 
Creek Consulting Group, started working as a Controller for an electronics 
retailer with 4 store locations and a service department. Not only was she 
responsible for accounting, she was also responsible for all aspects of 
processing including Point of Sale, Merchandise and Service Parts Inventory, 
PO’s, Sales Analysis reporting, system administration such as terminal set-up, 
passwords, QADM,RDB’s and much, much more.

The Order Processing report called Balance Due Report (2-8-34) was originally 
conceptually developed by Pauleen and later Tyler adopted it into their 
“canned” example reports.

Overview:

Retail Pro is a highly popular global POS software used in over 45,000 stores 
and 75 countries. With over 20 years of POS experience the software is the 
go-to choice for many big-name retailers including: Gucci, Louis Vuitton, 
Diesel, Oakley, American Apparel, Tom Ford, Estee Lauder, Puma, and United 
Colors of Benetton. Possessing all the great features of other modern POS 
systems like inventory, customer, and employee management functions, as well as 
unprecedented international business capabilities, the software almost seems 
too good to be true. Unfortunately it just may be so. In my research I 
uncovered a recent history of SEC charges, accounting fraud, and chapter 11 
bankruptcy that sent me running for the hills.

Retail Pro International LLC. started off as Retail Technologies Inc. in 
Folsom, CA. Coming from humble beginnings, the company seemed to be doing 
pretty well by 1997, reporting an estimated $36 million in sales. By December 
of 2002, the company had grown to a staff of 80 employees and sold part of its 
business to Intuit, the makers of QuickBooks Point of Sale. In 2004 an 
Irvine-based company by the name of Island Pacific Inc. bought Retail 
Technologies and by 2007 sold off its merchandising division Island Pacific 
Management Systems for $16 million. What was left was renamed Retail Pro Inc. 
and its offices were moved from Irvine to La Jolla, CA.

By 2008 problems started to arise for the company. The federal SEC filed 
fraud charges against Retail Pro Inc., its two former CEO's Barry Schechter and 
Ran Furman, and its one former CFO Harvey Braun. The three were involved in a 
fraudulent accounting scheme in which they improperly recorded and reported 
$3.9 million in revenue from a "barter transaction," whose sole purpose was to 
manipulate the company's books to reflect inflated revenue. The SEC uncovered 
overstated 2004 revenues by up to 140%, making the company show profit when in 
actuality it was in the red. To make matters worse the three executives 
concealed the barter from external auditors by forging documents. Schechter 
even sold his company stock shares during the scheme, an estimated 637,750 
shares for $1.5 million. A settlement was configured for each of the defendants 
with Schechter taking the biggest blow, having to pay an estimated $635,847.

In the midst of scandal Retail Pro was not doing well financially, defaulting 
on loans to investors Laurus Master Fund Ltd., Midsummer Investments Ltd., and 
Valens Offshore SPV II Corp. By January 2009 the company filed chapter 11 
bankruptcy. At the time the company's assets totaled about $25 million, with 
debts of $29 million and liabilities of $50 million, owing over 200 creditors. 
Some of these creditors included former Island Pacific co-owner Jeff Boone who 
lent $2.4 million, former CEO Michael Tomczak who also loaned $2.4 million, 
$101,486.10 to Oracle (the software's database provider), and $64,974 to the 
Hard Rock Hotel of San Diego (must've been a lot of partying going on!). News 
of the filing caused the company's 61.5 million stock shares to trade at less 
than a penny a share. Many retailers began abandoning the software as well; as 
one former user put it: "We are jumping ship as fast as we can...this company 
is doomed!"

Investment firms Laurus and Valens took ownership of the company following 
the bankruptcy and shut down the La Jolla office, moving all operations to 
Folsom. The company continued to operate during the transition and 
restructuring, and surprisingly did not lose as many customers or affiliates as 
expected. Under the new name Retail Pro International LLC. and new CEO Kerry 
Lemos (formerly of Hotel Information Systems and Sage), the company added more 
staff to the Folsom operations to total about 60, and is suspected of 
generating more than $1 million in monthly revenue.

Date Established:

1986.

Location:

Headquarters in Folsom, California 

, but also other satellite offices in the U.S., U.K., Latin America, China, and 
Australia..

Domain Name(s):

www.retailpro.com .

Price:

Since they don't sell any software themselves there is no official price 
listed. Prices vary from reseller to reseller; estimated to be in the low 
$1000s.

Web-Based or Locally-Installed:

Locally-Installed (see "Product Basics" for more info).

Specific Industry:

Retail Pro seems to be built for, and currently highly utilized by, apparel 
and specialty retail stores.

Specific Size of Business:

As stated, the Oracle database allows for any size business. As you can see 
from the company's list of customers in the overview, the software is capable 
of handling large chains on an international scale.

Ease of Use/User Friendly:

Honestly I cannot give a justified statement of user friendliness as I was 
unable to demo the software. However in most positive reviews I found, users 
were praising the software on its ease of use.

Hardware/Operating System Required:

Retail Pro does not divulge any specific hardware requirements on its site, 
stating only that

Retail Pro software can be easily configured to work with a wide variety of 
POS hardware devices and platforms.

Retail Pro does not sell any hardware themselves. In fact the company doesn't 
sell anything directly, including their own software! Everything is sold only 
through authorized company resellers (aka "business partners"). One of these 
partners namedRetail Information Systems  offers a 
full list of hardware requirementshere 

. Generally speaking you need the minimum following:


 * Windows XP Pro or higher 
 * Double Core CPU 
 * Single Processor 
 * 4 GB RAM 
 * 500 GB, 7200 rpm, 190 MB/sec hard drive Pretty harsh right?! Good news is 
most of the peripheral hardware is fairly flexible.

Product Basics:

Retail Pro is a locally installed POS software requiring all the traditional 
servers and backups for multi-station operation and data security. 
Unfortunately due to the lack of information provided by Retail Pro, as well as 
the fact that the company provides no demo or trial version of its software, my 
information from here on forth is fairly limited.

From what I know the system runs under a single module (unlike competitor 
Comcash ) 
with all features available along the top toolbar of a single interface: POS, 
Merchandise (inventory management), Purchasing (PO's, receiving), Transfers 
(inventory between stores), Sales (reporting), X/Z Out (closing and cash 
management), Customer Management, Employee Management, Tools, and Options. The 
system runs with an Oracle database allowing for unlimited scalability. Also it 
supports both SQL and XML formats for custom development.

There are two versions of the software available: the Shop Edition and the 
Merchant Edition. Shop is for merchants with 3 locations or less and 5 
terminals or less per location; it has slightly less functionality. Merchant is 
for anything greater.

Product Specialties/Features:

Once again limited info here.


 * POS - Like most other software we've seen, the POS function will 
automatically calculate and add sales tax, accept payment in multiple tenders 
(cash, check, credit, debit, gift card), allow customer info tracking, employee 
sales tracking, complete discounts/offers/special promotions, and allow for 
voids or returns. Dependant upon the customer or items being purchased, prompts 
can be set up for the cashier to suggest relevant up-sells, cross-sells, or 
volume discounts. Also receipts can be customized to include company logos and 
personal messages (e.g. "have a nice day!"). One neat function that's worth 
noting is the POS screen is customizable to perform special functions at 
different cash wraps (e.g. special orders, layaways, returns/exchanges, etc.). 
This sort of segregation can benefit customer queue speed by separating lengthy 
return/exchange transactions to a designated POS. 
 * Inventory Management - The system updates inventory instantaneously with 
every purchase or return allowing for real-time view of all levels. Maintain 
vendors, departments, items, styles, colors, sizes, SKUs, serial numbers, 
costs, prices, counts, and even item images. Also the system's style matrix 
allows for easy input and tracking of items that may vary by style, color, or 
size. Not only does the system also allow for the transfer of inventory between 
stores, but the auto-transfer recommendation function will prompt you to 
transfer when stock levels are skewed between stores. 
 * Purchase Order/Receiving Management - Preset your minimum and maximum stock 
levels for automatic notices to reorder inventory; or set for auto PO creation 
to even further simplify maintaining your inventory. Once items are received 
they will be allocated accordingly and inventory automatically updated. Also 
the system supports ASN (automated shipment notice) in-transit monitoring. 
ASN's are electronic files usually containing shipment date, time, ID #, 
packing slip data, freight information, item detail (including quantities), and 
PO #. Suppliers can send you an ASN electronically to sooner confirm received 
data and allow you to update your receiving open interface by increasing your 
in-transit supply and reducing your purchasing supply. 
 * Price Management - Multiple price levels, suggested pricing (based on 
costs), and time-based price changes (i.e. sales and promotions) are all 
possible. 
 * Employee Management - Secure login and monitoring, position-based security 
levels, cashier tracking, commission tracking, clocking in/out, tracking 
absences/tardies, and managing employee performance or productivity. 
 * International Features - In my opinion this is the only true standout of 
this software. The system supports a multi-language (up to 18 different 
languages) and multi-currency interface. You can select 1 currency as your base 
currency and then assign exchange rates as needed for foreign currency as well 
as dates for rates to take effect. This even allows you to purchase foreign 
items by assigning currency to vendors/items. You can also track costs by 
region or subsidiary. And advanced tax features make it easier to comply with 
regional fiscal requirements (international taxes). 
 * Advanced Reporting - The system comes with over 150 preloaded standard 
report options, among them being: stock levels, best/worst sellers, top 
employees, top customers, sales tax liability, sales activity, sales summary, 
price levels summary, item summary, profit margin reports, best/worst selling 
dept/store/style/vendor, PO reports, z-out reports, employee performance, and 
audit reports. Furthermore, all reports can be exported to Excel, Notepad, PDF, 
HTML, or Crystal Reports. 
 * Customer Management - Customer sales tracking allows you to create special 
offers/promotions/discounts based on past purchases, create email or direct 
marketing campaigns, or create special pricing for certain customers. The 
system also comes with a customer loyalty function to set up, manage, and 
execute a loyalty program. Rewards can be determined either on the currency 
value or point value of purchases. This can be done in three ways: total-based, 
item-based, and gift-based. Total-based means point values are calculated by 
the total amount of receipts (so you spend a certain amount of money and 
receive a certain amount of points). Item-based is the same thing except 
different items have different points and some are not included at all (so you 
can push certain goods you are trying to unload). Finally gift-based means 
customers receive free merchandise as opposed to points to redeem. All point 
information is updated instantaneously so there can be no double-dipping done 
due to slow data transfer. Also customers can check their balance at any time 
and redeem at any location within the same day of purchase (so if buying at one 
store, can use the points off that purchase right away, whether in the same 
store or a different location). 
 * Security - As is standard, the system follows PCI-DSS 
 
regulations, keeping all sensitive credit card data encrypted. 
 * Built-in Technician's Toolkit - An application within the system that 
contains tools for maintaining your database like re-indexing to add data 
files, update password files, backup your data, and configure various 
peripheral hardware. 
 * Web Store Integration - Retail Pro integrates with ecommerce application 
UniteU  to maintain accurate inventory counts whether a 
sale is made online or in your physical store. UniteU also integrates with 
websites like eBay and Amazon, collecting orders from them and passing them 
through to Retail Pro, widening your sales reach. Integrations/Add-Ons:

Being that company CEO Kerry Lemos used to work for Sage, it makes perfect 
sense that the software integrates with Sage accounting applications MAS 90 and 
MAS 200. Data seamlessly transfers to the GL and AR modules of MAS software to 
shortcut lengthy data re-entry that often comes along with bookkeeping.

Additionally, the company's Enterprise Integration Manager application 
(offered for an additional unknown fee) will help integrate the Retail Pro 
software with almost any other data management application. The manager's 
interface allows merchants to define data output formats, transformation rules, 
and map destination locations in conjunction with the specifications of the 
target application. If it sounds complicated to you don't worry...it does to me 
too.

Lastly I can't move on from this category without mentioning the Retail Pro 
app market , a place to purchase add-ons 
that will get you even more out of your Retail Pro software. Unfortunately a 
lot of these apps are overpriced and - in my opinion - things that should be 
standard with the software. Like the V9 Inventory CSV Tool ($1500.00) which 
will allow you to import/export CSV files to/from Retail Pro V9. Other apps 
include emailing receipts ($25.00), prompt to collect customer info ($450.00), 
prompt for item being sold past expire date ($250.00), and multiple ship-to 
customer addresses ($500.00). Some of the apps even run into the thousands of 
dollars, like the Microsoft Dynamics GP Accounting Link ($7000.00) or the 
TrendaSource Enterprise: Retail Pro Integrated Ecommerce Solution ($12,000.00).

Compatible Credit Card Processors:

Once again Retail Pro is very vague on which processors the software is 
compatible with for integrated credit card processing, stating that they offer,

a wide variety of integrated payment solutions to industry leading providers 
and processors (like) Shift4, PPI, and the list goes on.

Specifics for card-type payments (including gift cards) were not available, 
other than all card data is encrypted from point of swipe, with automatic 
authorization check, and signature capture required.

Customer Service/Technical Support:

Since Retail Pro does not sell anything themselves technical support is 
dependant on your reseller from which you purchase the software from, or a 
local Retail Pro software expert. Other than that, the My Retail Pro web portal 
provides users with access to a support knowledgebase of articles, a TV section 
of training videos,Retail Pro University 
 (featuring online as well as instructor led classes), a documentation section 
(filled with user guides, technical memos, and release notes), as well as a 
discussion board with questions and topics from other users.

Furthermore the Retail Pro blog , 
webinars , and newsletters 
 provide more information 
on retail practices in general, industry news, and specifics on new software 
features.

Negative Reviews/Complaints:

Thorough research uncovered few negative reviews, especially since service 
and technical support varies from partner to partner. Negative reviews 
regarding the actual software were actually very rare. In regards to 
troubleshooting one user said:

You have no where to go but to your local retail pro installer. The product 
is very unfriendly and impossible to support yourself even with the manual. We 
wanted to upgrade hardware and move the software to another machine, even with 
the disks and manual, this was impossible. If you buy this I suggest that you 
need a serious budget for support and consultancy. This may be OK on a large 
multiple store install but on a single station it may kill your project.  -

To do your own research for more complaints and reviews, you can search for 
terms like:


 * retail pro reviews 
 * retail pro complaints 
 * retail pro scam 
 * etc... Positive Reviews/Testimonials:

Retail Pro provides several testimonials 
 on their webpage, 
one of which is the following:

Capturing client information is very important. The nature of our product is 
that you replenish after running out in three months. With the customer data we 
capture through our POS system, we know when they run out and how they prefer 
to be contacted. This aims to increase both sales and profitability, because 
repeat purchases provide the highest margins. Each store is independent, but 
because they are all connected to the corporate system, the data flows back and 
forth seamlessly every day. I can sit in my office and run performance analyses 
to see how the whole enterprise is doing. This way, the company transforms data 
into business intelligence. We use the knowledge to guide inventory management, 
pricing, product development--everything to maximize efficiency, profitability 
and strategic growth. -Eric Malka, President and CEO, The Art of Shaving, Miami

Elsewhere on the web, many other positive reviews were found:

Retail Pro has a great inventory system that allows multiple vendors per 
item, multiple styles per item, and alternate skus for lookup (i.e. Your own 
item #, the vendor's item #, and the UPC). The purchase order system is very 
good, provides great tracking of backorder items, it has the capability of 
doing auto ordering based upon predefined min/max quantities. -Craig Anonymous

Easy to use POS/receiving/transfer system. Reports are numerous and easy to 
customize. It has saved us countless hours versus doing hand tickets. -Don of 
Am/Pat Inc.

Good for multi store environments. Really powerful software with tons of 
features best suited to the intermediate/advanced user. It is extremely 
flexible and almost everything can be user defined. -Susan Anonymous

Final Verdict:

With a severe lack of information I obviously cannot in good faith provide a 
high rating for Retail Pro. On the one hand the software is used by many 
high-end businesses, has many positive reviews (with few negatives), seems to 
come with a bounty of features, and is the only POS we've reviewed so far with 
such high international functionality. On the other hand there's bankruptcy, an 
SEC investigation, and no centralized sales or support center (sorta like the 
Avon of POS). Even though the company's past problems were the result of an 
entirely separate management, it's still a factor we cannot ignore.

If you're international (or looking to expand internationally) then Retail 
Pro is definitely worth checking out. But other than that, I don't see anything 
particularly amazing about this software.

 NCR Counterpoint POS and Retail 
Management Software

14 Reviews 

(4.1/5)  NCR provides a technology blueprint that enables retailers to drive 
traffic into their stores, sell more product and reduce their costs. The NCR 
Counterpoint solution includes an e-mail marketing tool, integrated ecommerce, 
mobile alerting, built-in gift card and customer loyalty programs and hardware 
specifically designed for the retail environment.

The NCR Counterpoint omni-channel solution is fully configurable to further 
improve retailers’ ability to manage their individual business effectively. 
Retailers can sell online using the integrated ecommerce solution and bring 
their products wherever their customers are gathering with mobile POS 
offerings. Use the integrated email marketing system which allows retailers to 
use customer data to develop email marketing campaigns to drive sales and 
increase loyalty. Mobile alerts give retailers the ability to set alerts on 
important in-store activities and have those alerts delivered to them in SMS or 
email format.

 POS terminals used with NCR Counterpoint systems can be customized to either 
be touchscreen or manual entry, depending on need. They also include 
intersystem messaging and employee tracking (clocking in/out) to provide 
appropriate communication within a retail operation. Users can track sales and 
pull daily reports, along with the ability to always take instant readings of 
drawer amounts.

 Built in PA-DSS compliant credit card processing and the ability to 
integrate with most accounting software applications allows NCR Counterpoint to 
be a great solution for users looking to keep a detailed account of expenses 
and revenue.

 NCR Counterpoint requires Microsoft SQL Server and Windows OS. It is offered 
as either an on-premise or hosted system and requires hardware from either NCR 
or a third-party. With a network of support and implementation staff across 
North America, NCR's retail solution is one we recommend very often to 
retailers looking for a full-featured system.


 Recent News

 There are a number recent events impacting users of the Radiant POS solution:


 *  NCR Corporation announced plans to acquire Radiant Systems, Inc. in July, 
2011. The acquisition would lead to Radiant Systems’ specialty and hospitality 
solution becoming an additional vertical to NCR’s core retail and financial 
offerings. The acquisition was completed in August, 2011. 
 *  CPMobile, a new mobile retail solution from NCR, launched in September, 
2011. The solution uses a credit card sled and integrates with Radiant 
CounterPoint point of sale solution. CPMobile runs on the Apple iPhone/iPod 
Touch and iPad (iOS version 5.0 or later required). 
 *  Radiant Systems CounterPoint SQL 8.3.9 was pushed live in February, 2011. 
This service pack updated biometric driver support, improved eCommerce and 
in-store inventory integration, and fixed bugs involving stored value cards. 
The next service pack is expected to go live mid-summer 2012. 
 *  A number of national groups have selected NCR-based point of sale products 
so far in 2012: the Green Bay Packers announced on February 2, 2012, that they 
would be implementing NCR technology at Lambeau Field; Harp Foods grocery 
stores announced in February 22, 2012, that they would be moving to upgraded 
NCR terminals and solutions in its stores; and School-Link Technologies, a 
technology solutions provider, now offers NCR point of sale solutions for its 
K-12th grade education clients beginning in May, 2012.

Reviews of NCR Counterpoint POS and Retail Management

Overall ratingReview by Cody from POS Nation | February 2013Ease-of-use
FunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportNCR Counterpart offers flexibility, 
which no one else can assure you for your business. The online shopping cart 
option also adds an extra advantage to the credibility of the software.

 The only shortcoming that i found quite unnecessary is the restricted use 
(IOS peripherals), but I'm sure that it will be overcome soon.
Overall ratingReview by Mary  from Nona Ruth's | January 2013Ease-of-use
FunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportNona Ruth's is a new table top 
retail gift shop. As a part of our star up we were in the market for a user 
friendly, robust point of sales system that would free up as much time as 
possible for taking care of our customers while at the same time providing as 
much info as possible to help us manage and grow our business. Just as 
important was the support and backup available from the provider.

 We spent considerable time and effort evaluating every provider we could 
scare up.
 CounterPoint and their local representative, Image Business Systems, has more 
than met our needs. The software is well designed, the initial training and 
start up effective, and the ongoing support very responsive.

 We whole heartedly endorse CounterPoint and if you are looking in the 
Birmingham area, suggest you save yourself time and effort and go directly to 
Image Business Systems.

Overall ratingReview by Beth from Sweet Brook Farm | October 2012Ease-of-use
FunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportFirst, an explanation on ratings. I 
would have given it five stars for Ease of Use, except that I am a new user and 
am still learning my way around the system. That said, it is easy to figure out 
how to do certain tasks, but when I can't figure it out, their customer support 
is top notch.

 We are a small farm that produces approximately 1,300 gallons of maple syrup 
each year, and we raise alpacas for their fiber. Our farm store is stocked with 
maple syrup and maple goodies, plus an inventory of alpaca products, from yarn 
to apparel to accessories.

 I went with CounterPoint, v8.4 because it is affiliated with NCR, a major 
corporation that has been around a long time. The implementation team at 
Radiant Systems was excellent. I had the system installed on my laptop, and so 
far it is working great. As a new user, I am still learning how to do certain 
tasks, and the project team has continued to hold my hand until I have mastered 
all the basics. We're almost there....

 It is too early to tell how I have benefited from the system, but I am 
looking forward to comparing my holiday retail season to last year, when I had 
little time to enjoy the holidays and limited resources to control my inventory.

 CounterPoint allows you to add on modules, such as integrated website 
management, gift card processing, scheduling and ticket sales, etc. RCS 
outsources these modules to other companies so they can focus directly on the 
point of sale functionality and improvements and assure that the modules work 
properly with CounterPoint.

 Lastly, RCS invited me to their users conference, which I highly recommend to 
any user of this POS program. The informational sessions covered all kinds of 
topics to better use CounterPoint, and it included sessions on retailing 
strategies that I found very helpful. RCS is truly a class act.Overall rating
Review byJacque from Bust Stop | October 2012Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct 
qualityCustomer supportThis system is the worst I have ever had and I have only 
had two in twenty one (21) year. There is know reason that this company should 
not have a manual or how about a help button that really work. This is really 
funny I printed out a report but I for got were it was on the system. So I went 
to help and put in the name of the report and it said it was not there. If you 
have a question and need to call tech suport it will cost you a arm and a leg 
for the information were if you had a manaual or a help button that really work 
it would save you money.Overall ratingReview by Terri from Girl Scouts, 
Hornets' Nest Council | January 2012Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct quality
Customer supportOur organization is a non-profit organization, but has a 
specialized shop. Our shop hours are not normal retail and our customers are 
sometimes very demanding. Our inventory ranges from thousands of patches to 
clothing, jewelry, etc. We have used CounterPoint since 2005. Our shop 
previously had a cash register and the old source of look and order on 
inventory. In 2005 the shop was handed over to new management, who researched 
and concluded to use CounterPoint. I have been at this shop for over two years 
and transferred from another shop that also used CounterPoint. We had version 
7.5 until this past August and we upgraded to SQL. Version 7 was great to work 
with but SQL is so much more... We are able to resource more reports than 
before, with the ease of being able to have the help menu available.

 The training of staff was so easy and quick to pickup. My staff and myself 
have had such a great time adapting to the new software. It is so easy to track 
inventory, sales, customers, and again the use of many new and different 
reports that help us on a daily basis. Our favorite is the 2 or 3 steps at the 
End of Day, with the older version there were so many steps and this is 1,2,3 
and complete. Our support team is highly professional and always answers our 
calls in a timely manner. We are also excited because we do not HAVE to call 
them as much now with the new SQL. I would highly recommend CounterPoint to 
anyone who asks.Overall ratingReview by Shelley from Romence Gardens Inc | 
January 2012Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportWe are a 
retail garden center. We sell trees, shrubs, perennials, roses, birdseed 
feeders, grass seed, fertilizer, insecticide, fungicide, lawn and garden 
ornaments. We are open all year. It is a family owned and operated store in 
business for 109 years. We looked at software to run our inventory about 6 
years ago. We settled on CounterPoint because of it ease of use and great 
function ability. Before CounterPoint we used a general cash register without 
UPC scanning capability.

 One of the main reasons we like it is for the great support we get from 
Randall Data Systems, the company that implemented the system. We have a huge 
inventory so the implementation took a few months. Karen, from Randall stuck 
tight with us throughout the whole implementation, and is available for every 
question we may have even now. She really knows her stuff!

 CounterPoint is very easy to use. I train new cashiers and they catch on 
quickly. Even the ones with no computer experience, although it does help if 
they have some. We are now able to see our inventory with the click of a 
button. We know when to reorder inventory and what we may have in back stock. 
We also now know the profit margin on everything we sell. We never knew this 
before.

 I truly recommend this software to everyone.Overall ratingReview by Sarah from
North Arkansas Guns, Inc. | September 2011Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct 
qualityCustomer supportWe are a retailer of firearms and just found out we are 
the first guinea pigs to use Counterpoint SQL 8.4.3. Since firearms are a 
regulated industry, they are always serialized. We purchased the bound book 
module to facilitate tracking the acquisition & disposition of firearms. In 
general, I do not find the system intuitive from a laypersons perspective. I 
can ring up a sale. However, receiving trade-ins on guns doesn't work.

 We can't take consignments. Serial #s are missing from the bound book table. 
Our VAR is too overwhelmed to speak to us for entire days, bringing our 
business to a standstill. There is a substantial list of fixes that have been 
submitted to the programmers, and no timetable has been given for when they 
will be completed. Meanwhile, our business is limping along.

 Software is supposed to make your life easier, so you can run your business. 
It has made our life harder, and we are losing business because we are spending 
so much time dealing with constant problems with the system. I have to 
hand-write labels for our firearms because the software cannot accommodate what 
we need to print on the label. We have paid about $30K for a system that we are 
totally frustrated with, and no one will get back to us as to when things will 
be fixed.Overall ratingReview by Sean from Hi-Time Wine Cellars | September 2011
Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportMy Company recently made 
the switch to CounterPoint Enterprise SQL 8.4 and would like to share my 
experience with Radiant Systems. We have been in business for over 50 years and 
have had several different POS systems and CounterPoint has been the best 
system by far. Implementing a new system is never easy but with the help of 
OneStep Retail Solutions this has been the easiest and the quickest 
implementation I have ever done.

 There are so many POS systems on the market finding the best fit for your 
business is a very difficult decision. Kevin McAdams and Jay Shore with OneStep 
Retail Solutions took the time to learn our business needs and recommended 
CounterPoint as the best solution. After using the system for over a month now 
I am glad I took their advice because this is a great system.

 The CounterPoint Gateway for processing credit cards is very fast. The touch 
screen terminals make ringing up customers quick and easy. The ability to 
customize searches and change the information displayed through the column 
designer makes looking up the information a breeze. The reporting is equally 
fast, flexible and easy to use for all of our staff members.

 Blythe Franks, our business analyst from OneStep Retail Solutions has played 
a key role in making this transition from our old system to CounterPoint. Her 
experience and knowledge of the product has made implementation and integration 
of the system quick and easy. With her insight we were able to customize 
CounterPoint to meet all of our business needs making our company more 
efficient than ever.

Overall ratingReview by Gary from Polo Gear, Inc. | August 2011Ease-of-use
FunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportWe have been using CounterPoint 
software for over 10 years. The solution serves the retail environment well - 
it is easy to use and easy to teach new staff to use. Radiant has continued to 
develop it to meet the new world of Internet sales and marketing. I love the 
fact that our online store integrates into our retail database. As a result, we 
only have to worry about one set of data that updates to our website with two 
easy clicks.

 I also have to say that customer service is very good. Our CounterPoint reps, 
Sandy and Kevin, are super. Sabrina helps us maintain, develop and keep up our 
website, and she is terrific. They are responsive and helpful, and really try 
to help us understand and solve problems. The online help portal is also good, 
and teaches as well as solves problems.

 Overall, I would recommend CounterPoint to those who need a point of sale 
system, and/or Internet software that is very sophisticated in capability, but 
remains easy to use.Overall ratingReview by Greg from Lighthouse Marine 
Distributors | August 2011Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer 
supportWe operate a marine wholesale distributorship, along with a retail 
operation. Our three sources of revenue are store traffic, phone orders and 
Internet orders.

 Our previous software system, while specific to the marine industry and 
bundled with features we sorely miss, was unable to integrate e-commerce, point 
of sale, and shipping functionality. The time we spent dealing with each order 
on three different levels was time-consuming, and also allowed for the 
introduction of errors.

 We are currently running version 8.3.9 of CounterPoint, but will be upgrading 
to 8.4 as soon as the season slows this fall. The implementation experience was 
choppy, to say the least, due to a reseller that wasn't up to speed on the 
software. This hiccup notwithstanding, we were able grasp the basics and run 
with it.

 We have been using CounterPoint for just under two years now and the 
watershed moment was when we switched partners nine months into the project. 
Our reseller's knowledge of the system and ability to teach us its 
functionality have allowed us to move forward at a rapid pace. The program is 
easy to use, and a common logic follows through the system so even when playing 
with new features, the desired result is easy to achieve.

 Our current partner could stand to be slightly more responsive, especially to 
issues I consider to be very basic requirements in a system of this size and 
power.

 We are currently 95% integrated with UPS WorldShip. The only thing holding us 
back from 100% integration is CounterPoint's inability to receive tracking 
numbers back from WorldShip without cumbersome export and import of data, or 
utilizing a third-party program. We are currently investigating CPOnline with 
the hope of having full vertical integration by January 1, 2012.

 So far, we have been able to streamline sales, shipping & purchasing with 
more good things to come!More Reviews »

Not so long ago, the most advanced piece of technology present at the 
intersection of consumer and retailer was the cash register. Today, buyers are 
bringing their own technology on their shopping trips - and trailing a very 
revealing online data footprint. One big enterprise software company is 
promising retailers new technology that will let retailers leverage that 
information to market to those consumers in real-time.

For retailers and tech companies that serve them, billions of dollars are up 
for grabs. If there were any doubts that there was real money to be made 
leveraging big data to create custom marketing pitches in real time, those 
doubts should be shattered by Tuesday's entrance of mega-software corporation 
SAP into the retail tech frenzy. The move is the equivalent of an elephant 
walking into a room of working mice and telling everyone, "I've got this."



SAP's product is a new implementation of its upcoming NetWeaver Cloud called 
SAP Precision Retailing 
 
that uses the consumer's location, social profile, needs and the time at which 
they are conducting their business to generate relevant content (including 
discounts and special deals) designed to get that particular consumer to make 
the purchases the retailer desires. Technology, then, as virtual salesperson.

On the surface, this is nothing new. Social media profiles have been used as 
a marketing tool for quite a while now, as have location-based services that 
suggest a business or product to you when you're nearby. SAP's product, though, 
is a major effort to combine a lot of different inputs and process them in 
real-time. SAP's pragmatic approach to this new market runs right up to the 
point of being just a bit creepy.

Real-Time Analysis In Aisle 14

All of this real-time processing promises a very personalized level of 
interaction between the retailer and consumer, according to Herve Pluche, Vice 
President, Retail Consumer Mobile Initiative, SAP Lab, enabling the retailer to 
"influence behavior."

That retailers are in the business of influencing customers is not new either 
- visit most any U.S. grocery store and you'll have to schlep back to the rear 
of the store just to get your milk. The store is trying to make sure you see 
lots of other items to tempt you along the way. But SAP's determination to 
extol the processing benefits of its new system seems destined to raise 
eyebrows among privacy advocates.

The profile aspect of the new Precision Retailing product could be a red 
flag, since it mines past transaction history (online and in-store) and social 
media profiles to help figure out what it is you need and want. Customers using 
this service will likely have given permission to the retailer to perform such 
actions when they click "Accept" for the Terms of Service, so there's no 
technical breach of privacy, but such real-time analysis could tip consumers 
into the creeped-out zone when they see it in action?

Of course, SAP is not exactly trying to ease customer's minds here: it wants 
to sell this system to the businesses that can use the capabilities. And it may 
not be a hard sell. The product is already in use, and doing pretty well.

Pluche related that one European grocery retailer with 12,000 stores in seven 
countries is using the Precision Retailing system to deliver discount 
information into customers' hands via smart devices and in-store kiosks. The 
promotions were often the same ones that were email- and direct mail-blasted to 
customers, but Pluche explained that identical promotions see a conversion rate 
eight times higher when delivered directly as opposed to mass-distributed. 
That's a piece of data sure to attract the attention of retailers.

The Numbers Behind SAP's Product

Retailers are very motivated to get technology like this in place. A recent 
Retail Systems Research study 

 noted the "top 3 technologies reported by survey respondents were customer 
purchase analytics, CRM, and marketing operations planning" - right where SAP's 
new product lives. And despite few problems collecting customer data, only 56% 
of the retailer respondents now believe they know who their best shoppers are, 
a big drop from last year's 73% figure.

There's also a little Inside Baseball action happening here. Precision 
Retailing's core technology,NetWeaver Cloud 
, is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud 
computing product that has not yet been generally released. NetWeaver Cloud 
relies on SAP's HANA in-memory database, which competes directly withOracle's 
Exadata X3 database announced at OracleWorld this weekend 

. SAP's launch of Precision Retailing is no doubt going to be used as an early 
showcase of what NetWeaver Cloud can do.

So ready or not, consumers are going to see a lot more use of their shopping 
and social data driving future transactions, because retailers are increasingly 
shifting in that direction. SAP may be one of the largest players in this 
rapidly evolving space, but it won't be the last.

Choosing A Retail Computer System

Your choice in a retail point of sale system is vital to the success and 
stability of your business. It is the hub around which everything revolves. You 
should have confidence in – and receive performance from – the system that is 
ultimately responsible for customer transactions, inventory management and 
every other action in your supply chain and tracking.



Let's walk through some important questions you should ask yourself when 
choosing a Retail System:

What Type Of Business Are You?

POS Systems are typically grouped in 2 separate categories: 
Restaurant/Hospitality and Retail. Restaurants are somewhat of a different 
breed – the focus of this article is Retail POS Systems.

Within the retail sector, pricing on Point Of Sale Systems can range from a 
couple hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. There are POS systems 
customized for every type of business under the sun, fromGift Shops 
 and Mall Kiosks 
 to Pet Stores 
 and Bike Shops 
.

Custom features are great BUT, the most important feature of your retail 
system is that it's easy to use. What good is a feature if it's too hard to use 
or buried among so many other features that you can't find it? Business owners 
are opting for simple, streamlined retail POS systems that focus on 
fundamentals and deliver them flawlessly. This is why so many entrepreneurs are 
turning toweb based point of sale systems 
 to fulfill their 
retail computer needs.

What POS Computers & Software Are Best For Me?

Do you prefer Windows? Mac OS X 
? Perhaps 
Linux? You can find great POS Systems that are equally powerful on any of these 
platforms, so choose the platform with which you're already the most 
comfortable.

In the past, POS systems were typically installed on business computers as 
software packages, much like Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint come packaged 
on Windows computers. Unfortunately, software based POS Systems present many 
problems and vulnerabilities that small and medium sized business have found 
overwhelming.

What about software updates? What if my computer breaks? How do I backup and 
save all my data? What if the platform needs patches or problems are found in 
the operating system or software?

These are questions you shouldn't have to deal with as a business owner — 
after all, why invest in a POS System that creates even more questions and 
uncertainties? Web based retail systems are solving these problems for many 
small retailers.

Advantages of Web Based Retail Systems


 * Software features and improvements are continually added and updated 
automatically. You never deal with software updates, downloads and changes. 
Someone else takes care of it for you. 
 * Because the solution is web based, you can access your inventory from any 
internet enabled computer in the world. A computer breaking becomes an 
incredibly minor problem. 
 * What happens if your computer crashes and it cannot be fixed? With a web 
based POS your information is continuously saved to a remote location that can 
be recovered even if your actual computer cannot be. Do You Have a Dedicated 
Retail IT Department?

Probably not! What small business can afford dedicating employees solely to 
managing their computers?

When something goes wrong with your system, how long can you afford for your 
business to be “down”? How long will it take to explain your problem via 
telephone or e-mail and to be walked through the steps? How long will it take 
for an IT professional to arrive to fix your POS System?

That's one of the beauties of a web based point of sale – experts can log 
into your system and fix the problem for you. This alleviates many of the 
support problems inherent of typical desktop software-based point of sale 
systems.

POS Bundles or Mix and Match?

If you're a brand new business or implementing a POS System for the first 
time, you can buy a package that will include every component needed to get up 
and running immediately… from your computer to your barcode scanners and 
receipt printer. You can realize great discounts for buying an all-inclusive 
bundle and for many entrepreneurs, this is the best idea.

Other companies may have existing hardware they'd like to use with their new 
system. Or, they may be cost conscious companies looking to achieve 
affordability through the purchase of refurbished hardware and use of existing 
hardware.

So What's The Bottom Line?

While companies seeking POS Systems are typically looking for customized 
hardware and traditional software bundles, small and medium sized businesses 
“in the know” prefer web based POS solutions for their flexibility, 
affordability and overall ability to deliver great results with premium service.

Startups use Kinect to solve problems in surgery, retail, filmmaking and more 




Walking the floor at Microsoft’s conference center in Redmond, Wash., 
yesterday for the conclusion of the company's three-month Kinect Accelerator 
program  

for startups, it was remarkable to see not just tech demos but full-fledged 
companies being built on the company’s Kinect sensor.


 Todd Bishop / GeekWire 

Toronto-based GestSure Technologies uses Kinect to give surgeons 
gesture-based control over computers in the operating room.


 * A Los Angeles-based startup called Styku 
 has struck a deal to pilot its Kinect-powered virtual fitting room technology 
with a major retailer, a key step toward a broader rollout.
 * Toronto-based GestSure Technologies , has just 
received U.S. clearance to start offering its Kinect-based, hands-free 
technology for surgeons in operating rooms.
 * Ikkos Training , based in Seattle, has 
developed a Kinect app for virtual physical therapy, to supplement traditional 
sessions. The sensor can count repetitions, among other features.
 * Nconnex , of Hadley, Mass., lets consumers scan a room 
with Kinect and insert virtual representations of furniture into the digital 
scene to see what it would look like in their space.
 * New York-based Voxon  is using Kinect to give 
artists and cinematographers the ability to create volumetric 3D productions 
reminiscent of the famous Princess Leia hologram from Star Wars.
 * ZebCare , from Boston, is using the Kinect to let 
families check the status of independent seniors without invading their 
privacy, providing a blurred-out overhead view and analytics.(Msnbc.com is a 
joint venture of Microsoft and NBC Universal.)

Those are just some of the examples — we saw more during an earlier tour of 
Microsoft’s Seattle offices 

. It’s easy to forget, less than two years ago, some of these same people were 
worried they might face the company in court instead 

.

“When we started hacking around, we felt a little illegal,” recalled Nicolas 
Burrus, who was one of the original Kinect hackers as the developer of the 
open-source RGBDemo toolkit for the Xbox 360 version of Kinect 
. “We were at the 
borderline of what we could do for something that was really designed for 
games.”

Burrus is one of the co-founders of Manctl , a 
startup based in Lyon, France, that has spent the past three months in Seattle 
as one of eleven companies in the Kinect Accelerator program, operated by 
Microsoft in conjunction with the TechStars incubator.

“When Microsoft decided to really embrace this movement and go with Kinect 
for Windows, and really help us go much further, we felt good about it, 
excited,” Burrus said. “Now it’s really amazing because we have access to the 
Kinect for Windows team, the Kinect hardware team, all the Microsoft people are 
helping us. It really feels like we are being recognized.”

TechStars and Microsoft were flooded with interest in the program after it 
was announced in November 
, 
receiving almost 500 applications and accommodating the demand by adding one 
more slot beyond the 10 they had originally planned. TechStars took minority 
equity stakes in the companies as part of the program, its traditional practice.

Each startup received $20,000 as part of the program, but Microsoft didn’t 
seek any equity.

Each startup received $20,000 as part of the program, but Microsoft didn’t 
seek any equity.

“We want to see these companies go out and be true proof points on their 
own,” said Michael Mott, a Microsoft Studios general manager.

One of the additional benefits for Microsoft was the real-time feedback loop 
between the startups and the Kinect for Windows team, which was able to 
incorporate that feedback as they made updates to the Kinect software 
development kit.

Having completed the Kinect Accelerator program, each of the eleven companies 
showed off its work to investors yesterday at the Demo Day, many of them 
seeking additional investments to fuel their next wave of growth.

David Cohen, the TechStars CEO, said during an interview with GeekWire 

 that he was impressed enough with some of the startups to be considering 
additional investments of his own.

“It’s really interesting how one innovation can drive so much activity,” he 
said.

 How to 
Solve Retail Problems Through Virtualization

By David Spark  | Nov 8, 2012 Posted In 
Business Analysis , Living in 
Tech  Tags: IT & Data Center 
 Add a comment  
  

  “Retailers are not known for disruption,” says Rick 
Terlep of VMware. “They’re not in the business of disrupting the 
infrastructure. They’re in the business of selling things.”

Terlep, along with his colleague Chris Scrudato, shared their thoughts in a 
session titled “Solving the Problems of the Modern Retailer Through 
Virtualization” at the VMworld 2012 conference in San Francisco recently. But 
even if retailers are not disruptive themselves, as Terlep noted, when change 
happens, retailers have to adapt or they could lose out tremendously.

The change started with the introduction of digital commerce, which made a 
large selection of merchandise available online, along with detailed 
information about retailers, and reviews and opinions of other customers. It 
became easy for consumers to research products and even shop before going to a 
physical store.

Higher customer satisfaction for online stores

Customer satisfaction for online stores is about 11 percent higher than for 
brick-and-mortar stores. Amazon claims that they are the highest-ranked 
retailer ever in terms of customer satisfaction. During the 2011 holiday 
shopping season, over half of adults used smartphones for purchase decisions. 
By 2014, experts expect that 90 percent of phones will be smartphones, Terlep 
said.

Many retailers are unfortunately stuck in the analog era. Some were burned by 
eCommerce 1.0. Retailers like incremental change, but they’re now selling 
through multiple channels, or “omni-channel retailing,” and that changes the 
dynamic greatly, said Terlep.

Omni-channel retailing means seamlessly bringing the digital and physical 
together. Shoppers now have limitless selection available, price 
transparency, personalized recommendations, face-to-face interaction with 
experts, and the ability to examine or try-on products in person.

This is all a very different shopping experience for consumers. For 
retailers, it requires organizational and technology changes, Terlep said.

Recommendations for the redesign of retail IT

From the technical standpoint, Terlep recommends:


 * Production of flexible architectures to enable faster changes that are less 
disruptive. 
 * Reducing in-store endpoint count/truck rolls. For example, a virtual point 
of sale, digital signage, and/or kiosk. 
 * Creating the ability to access volumes of data near real-time. From the 
organizational standpoint, Terlep suggests the following:


 * Design a new application with a new look and feel. 
 * Fulfill the special needs of eCommerce. 
 * Improve integration between line of business and IT. Retail IT is funded on 
a project-by-project basis from the line of business. This isn’t as big a 
problem in retail as it is with other industries. 
 * Hiring a staff of builders not administrators. About David Spark

“Creating greater awareness and educating the public about protecting human 
health and the environment is an EPA priority, and serious games an be useful 
tools for users to learn about processes and systems reflective of the real 
world.

By cooperating with IBM CityOne developers, EPA is helping users by allowing 
them to more thoroughly investigate environmental issues and better understand 
complex energy and water interactions presented in the game. EPA's 
collaboration in this project will help increase awareness and understanding of 
how different choices that are made in the various game scenarios affect 
environmental outcomes."

"As a federal entity, EPA does not endorse any particular product and remains 
available to cooperate with other companies in similar ventures in the future."

happening (usually because they get bonuses tied to performance); and when they 
have authority to act so as to continuously improve what’s happening (so they 
can earn higher bonuses). That means everybody needs access to timely and 
relevant information so they can act in real time to optimize their performance 
as conditions change.

 – Michael Hugos

Intrapreneurship"The chief thing you as an innovation leader must realize is 
that when it comes to making innovation happen,people matter more than ideas. 

 Take a moment to think about that. Many innovation initiatives fail miserably 
because their leaders don't understand this simple fact. In fact, it is 
actually more important to have A-grade people than it is to have a slew of 
A-grade ideas because A-grade people can take a B-grade idea - or perhaps even 
a C-grade idea - and turn it into a successful reality. B-grade people, on the 
other hand, will struggle with even truly great ideas.

 So before you get all fired up about generating a ton of ideas, first figure 
out how you're going to match those ideas to people who can make things happen."

 – Stefan Lindegaard 
 *  
Responsiveness“By being responsive to the needs and desires of specific groups 
of customers, companies can wrap their products and services in a blanket of 
value-added services to consistently earn an additional two to four percent 
(and sometimes more) in gross margin than they would otherwise earn for the 
product or service alone. This customer and market specialization is the most 
promising and the most sustainable source of profits in our fluid, real-time 
economy.”

 – Michael Hugos

Smarter Serious Games 


IBM Smartplay integrates real processes and real data into problem-solving 
games  

Real World Games, Real World Impact 

What do athletes, soldiers, doctors, and IT professionals have in common? 
They are all using serious games to prepare themselves for events – potentially 
disastrous – that occur outside the norm of their trade. Serious games are 
video games that do more than entertain; in that they prepare professionals to 
work smarter by enabling them to visualize the consequences of their actions 
and explore different permutations of events in a visceral way.

In case you still think that games are solely the domain of 14-year-old boys, 
67 percent of U.S. heads of households play games, and the number is even 
higher in Asia. The average age of a game player is 35, and 47 percent of PC 
gamers are older. Forty-three percent of PC gamers and 38 percent of console 
gamers are women, according to theEntertainment Software Association 
 

IBM has been developing serious games for some time that can teach problem 
solving for real issues in key industries, helping companies to learn how to 
work smarter. With CityOne, IBM is going a step further by developing a game in 
which users experience some of the complex problems facing cities. They can 
implement changes and understand the results in terms of how various technology 
solutions can help revolutionize industries within a municipality.

 Markup



Markup is the difference between the cost of an item and its selling price. 

Markup is the opposite of discount. In discount, we reduce some percentage of 
amount from the initial amount, but in markup we increase certain percentage 
with the original amount.The mark up is the gross profit 
 on a particular item or 
service. If the cost is 100 and it sells for 150 the mark up is 50%. The net 
profit takes in to account other factors like the rent of premises, cost of 
advertising and so on. The mark up is just the gross profit, so in the given 
example the mark up would be 50.



  Markup Definition

Back to Top  
 Markup is define, when the difference between the retail price of the 
merchandise and its cost. Markup is most commonly used to apply to the amount 
added to the cost to determine the retail prices of individual items.

A rise in the price of an particular item for a sale, we add amount to a cost 
price in calculating selling price.

Markup formula:

Markup = Retail - Cost

We may also write formula as

Cost = Retail - Markup

Retail = Cost + Markup
Markup Percentage

Back to Top  
 Below you could see formula for markup percent
Markup Percentage = 100 x $\frac{sale price - cost}{cost}$
Example: If the sale price of the toy is 300 dollar and exact cost of the toy 
is 75 dollar. Calculate markup percentage.

Solution: Given sale price = $ 300 
 cost price = $ 75

Apply formula to calculate markup percent

Markup Percentage = 100 x $\frac{sale price - cost}{cost}$

Markup Percentage = 100 x $\frac{300 - 75}{75}$

= 100 x 3
= 300 % How to Calculate Markup

Back to Top  
If we know the cost price and percentage markup, then the sales price will be 
the amount of markup sum the original cost.


For example, if the markup is 50% and the original cost is 6.00 dollars, then 
sales price becomes dollar 6.00 + dollar 6.00 x$\frac{50}{100}$ = 9.00 dollars.

Let us see the how to calculate markup price for any quantity.

Markup 

Let us assume

Sale price = $3400

 cost price is $2900

Markup = Sale price - Cost price

 = 3400 - 2900

 = $500

Markup Pricing Example

Back to Top  
 Below you could see the markup pricing examples Solved Examples

Question 1: A retailer is using a 40% as markup rate on software for 
computers, if the cost price of a game is 25 dollars, Calculate the selling 
price of a game?
 Solution:   
The markup = 40% `xx` cost price

Markup = 40% `xx` 25

= 40 x $\frac{25}{100}$

= 10

Selling price= cost + markup

=10+25

= 35

Selling Price is 35 dollars.

 

Question 2: If the markup used by the shopkeeper is 40%, then find the cost of 
watch, selling price for that is 63 dollars.
 Solution:   
Let us assume cost price is x.

markup = 40% of the cost, selling price will be the sum of markup and cost.

63 = x + ($\frac{40}{100}$)x
63 = 1.40x
x = $\frac{63}{1.40}$

X= 45

So the cost for the shoes is 45 dollars.
 

Question 3: If a shopkeeper is using the markup as 50% on an item, then find 
the selling price of that item if the cost is given as 100 dollars.
 Solution:   
Markup = 50% of the cost price

Markup = 50% of 100

= 50

selling price = cost + markup

= 100+50

= 150

So the selling price of the item is 150 dollars.

Enterprise software, also known as enterprise application software (EAS), is 
software  used in organizations 
, such as in a business 
 or government,[1] 
 as opposed to 
software used by individuals. Enterprise software is an integral part of a 
(computer based)Information System 
.

Services provided by enterprise software are typically business-oriented 
tools such as online shopping and online payment processing, interactive 
product catalogue, automated billing systems, security,enterprise content 
management , IT 
service management , 
customer relationship management 
, enterprise 
resource planning , 
business intelligence , 
project management , 
collaboration , human resource 
management , 
manufacturing,enterprise application integration 
, and 
enterprise forms automation 
.

Due to the cost of building or buying what is often non-free proprietary 
software , only large 
enterprises employ a software program that models their entire business system.[
citation needed ]

As enterprises have similar departments and systems in common, enterprise 
software is often available as a suite of customizable programs. Generally, the 
complexity of these tools requires specialist capabilities and specific 
knowledge.

] Definitions

Enterprise software describes a collection of computer programs with common 
business applications, tools for modeling how the entire organization works, 
and development tools for building applications unique to the organization.[2] 
 The software is 
intended to solve an enterprise-wide problem, rather than a departmental 
problem. Enterprise level software aims to improve the enterprise's 
productivity and efficiency by providing business logic support functionality.

According to Martin Fowler , 
"Enterprise applications are about the display, manipulation, and storage of 
large amounts of often complex data and the support or automation ofbusiness 
processes  with that data."[3] 


Although there is no single, widely accepted list of enterprise software 
characteristics,[4] 
 they generally 
includeperformance , 
scalability , and robustness 
. Furthermore, 
enterprise software typically has interfaces to other enterprise software (for 
exampleLDAP 
 todirectory services ) and is 
centrally managed (a single admin page, for example).[5] 


Enterprise application software 
 performs business functions 
such as order processing, procurement, production scheduling, customer 
information management, energy management, and accounting. It is typically 
hosted on servers and provides simultaneous services to a large number of 
users, typically over a computer network. This is in contrast to a single-user 
application that is executed on a user's personal computer and serves only one 
user at a time.

[edit 

] Types

Enterprise software can be categorized by business function. Each type of 
enterprise application can be considered a "system" due to the integration with 
a firm's business processes.[6] 
 Categories of 
enterprise software may overlap due to this systemic interpretation. For 
example, IBM's Business Intelligence platform (Cognos), integrates with a 
predictive analytics platform (SPSS) and can obtain records from its database 
packages (Infosphere, DB2). Blurred lines between package functions make 
delimitation difficult, and in many ways larger software companies define these 
somewhat arbitrary categories.[7] 
 Nevertheless, 
certain industry standard product categories have emerged, and these are shown 
below :


 * Accounting software  
 * Business intelligence  
 * Business process management 
 
 * Content management system 
 (CMS) 
 * Customer relationship management 
 (CRM) 
 * Database  
 * Master data management 
 (MDM) 
 * Enterprise resource planning 
 (ERP) [edit 

] Developers

Major organizations in the enterprise software field include SAP 
, IBM , 
BMC Software , HP Software Division 
, Redwood Software 
, IFS AB 
, QAD Inc 
, UC4 Software 
, JBoss 
 (Red Hat 
), Microsoft 
, Adobe Systems 
, Oracle Corporation 
, CA Technologies 
 and Wipro Technologies 
 but there are thousands of 
competing vendors globally.

[edit 

] Enterprise Social Software

Businesses also use Enterprise Social Software sometimes known as Enterprise 
2.0. Yammer Inc. which was sold to Microsoft is an example of such software.

Learn to solve word problems

This is a collection of word problem solvers that solve your problems and 
help you understand the solutions. All problems arecustomizable (meaning that 
you can change all parameters). We try to have a comprehensive collection of 
school algebra problems. The good news is that the steps to solve word problems 
are always the same. The bad news is that you may have to think pretty hard.

 Here's a run down on what you need to do for a typical age word problem 
, with a little example. 

The older brother Bob is two year older than his little sister Alice. Taken 
together, the sum of their ages is 8. 
 * Read the problem carefully. 
 * Get rid of clutter 
 * Identify key variables (unknowns). 
 * Eliminate unneeded variables. 
 * Use the text of the problem to write equations. 
 * Solve the equation. 
 * Find the remaining variables. 
 * The older brother Bob is two year older than his little sister Alice. Taken 
together, the sum of their ages is 8. 
 * Bob is two years older than Alice. Bob's age plus Alice's age = 8. 
 * Bob's age B and Alice's age A 
 * Get rid of B. Bob is 2 years older than Alice, so you can use A+2 instead 
of B 
 * Sum of their ages is 8. A + (A+2) = 8. 
 * Solve the equation using my Universal math simplifier and solver 

 (click here!). 
 * With the link above, you just found Alice's Age A=3. Bob's age is two years 
older, which is 5. Introduction

 NCR Counterpoint POS and Retail 
Management Software

14 Reviews 

(4.1/5)  NCR provides a technology blueprint that enables retailers to drive 
traffic into their stores, sell more product and reduce their costs. The NCR 
Counterpoint solution includes an e-mail marketing tool, integrated ecommerce, 
mobile alerting, built-in gift card and customer loyalty programs and hardware 
specifically designed for the retail environment.

The NCR Counterpoint omni-channel solution is fully configurable to further 
improve retailers’ ability to manage their individual business effectively. 
Retailers can sell online using the integrated ecommerce solution and bring 
their products wherever their customers are gathering with mobile POS 
offerings. Use the integrated email marketing system which allows retailers to 
use customer data to develop email marketing campaigns to drive sales and 
increase loyalty. Mobile alerts give retailers the ability to set alerts on 
important in-store activities and have those alerts delivered to them in SMS or 
email format.

 POS terminals used with NCR Counterpoint systems can be customized to either 
be touchscreen or manual entry, depending on need. They also include 
intersystem messaging and employee tracking (clocking in/out) to provide 
appropriate communication within a retail operation. Users can track sales and 
pull daily reports, along with the ability to always take instant readings of 
drawer amounts.

 Built in PA-DSS compliant credit card processing and the ability to 
integrate with most accounting software applications allows NCR Counterpoint to 
be a great solution for users looking to keep a detailed account of expenses 
and revenue.

 NCR Counterpoint requires Microsoft SQL Server and Windows OS. It is offered 
as either an on-premise or hosted system and requires hardware from either NCR 
or a third-party. With a network of support and implementation staff across 
North America, NCR's retail solution is one we recommend very often to 
retailers looking for a full-featured system.


 Recent News

 There are a number recent events impacting users of the Radiant POS solution:


 *  NCR Corporation announced plans to acquire Radiant Systems, Inc. in July, 
2011. The acquisition would lead to Radiant Systems’ specialty and hospitality 
solution becoming an additional vertical to NCR’s core retail and financial 
offerings. The acquisition was completed in August, 2011. 
 *  CPMobile, a new mobile retail solution from NCR, launched in September, 
2011. The solution uses a credit card sled and integrates with Radiant 
CounterPoint point of sale solution. CPMobile runs on the Apple iPhone/iPod 
Touch and iPad (iOS version 5.0 or later required). 
 *  Radiant Systems CounterPoint SQL 8.3.9 was pushed live in February, 2011. 
This service pack updated biometric driver support, improved eCommerce and 
in-store inventory integration, and fixed bugs involving stored value cards. 
The next service pack is expected to go live mid-summer 2012. 
 *  A number of national groups have selected NCR-based point of sale products 
so far in 2012: the Green Bay Packers announced on February 2, 2012, that they 
would be implementing NCR technology at Lambeau Field; Harp Foods grocery 
stores announced in February 22, 2012, that they would be moving to upgraded 
NCR terminals and solutions in its stores; and School-Link Technologies, a 
technology solutions provider, now offers NCR point of sale solutions for its 
K-12th grade education clients beginning in May, 2012.

Reviews of NCR Counterpoint POS and Retail Management

Overall ratingReview by Cody from POS Nation | February 2013Ease-of-use
FunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportNCR Counterpart offers flexibility, 
which no one else can assure you for your business. The online shopping cart 
option also adds an extra advantage to the credibility of the software.

 The only shortcoming that i found quite unnecessary is the restricted use 
(IOS peripherals), but I'm sure that it will be overcome soon.
Overall ratingReview by Mary  from Nona Ruth's | January 2013Ease-of-use
FunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportNona Ruth's is a new table top 
retail gift shop. As a part of our star up we were in the market for a user 
friendly, robust point of sales system that would free up as much time as 
possible for taking care of our customers while at the same time providing as 
much info as possible to help us manage and grow our business. Just as 
important was the support and backup available from the provider.

 We spent considerable time and effort evaluating every provider we could 
scare up.
 CounterPoint and their local representative, Image Business Systems, has more 
than met our needs. The software is well designed, the initial training and 
start up effective, and the ongoing support very responsive.

 We whole heartedly endorse CounterPoint and if you are looking in the 
Birmingham area, suggest you save yourself time and effort and go directly to 
Image Business Systems.

Overall ratingReview by Beth from Sweet Brook Farm | October 2012Ease-of-use
FunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportFirst, an explanation on ratings. I 
would have given it five stars for Ease of Use, except that I am a new user and 
am still learning my way around the system. That said, it is easy to figure out 
how to do certain tasks, but when I can't figure it out, their customer support 
is top notch.

 We are a small farm that produces approximately 1,300 gallons of maple syrup 
each year, and we raise alpacas for their fiber. Our farm store is stocked with 
maple syrup and maple goodies, plus an inventory of alpaca products, from yarn 
to apparel to accessories.

 I went with CounterPoint, v8.4 because it is affiliated with NCR, a major 
corporation that has been around a long time. The implementation team at 
Radiant Systems was excellent. I had the system installed on my laptop, and so 
far it is working great. As a new user, I am still learning how to do certain 
tasks, and the project team has continued to hold my hand until I have mastered 
all the basics. We're almost there....

 It is too early to tell how I have benefited from the system, but I am 
looking forward to comparing my holiday retail season to last year, when I had 
little time to enjoy the holidays and limited resources to control my inventory.

 CounterPoint allows you to add on modules, such as integrated website 
management, gift card processing, scheduling and ticket sales, etc. RCS 
outsources these modules to other companies so they can focus directly on the 
point of sale functionality and improvements and assure that the modules work 
properly with CounterPoint.

 Lastly, RCS invited me to their users conference, which I highly recommend to 
any user of this POS program. The informational sessions covered all kinds of 
topics to better use CounterPoint, and it included sessions on retailing 
strategies that I found very helpful. RCS is truly a class act.Overall rating
Review byJacque from Bust Stop | October 2012Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct 
qualityCustomer supportThis system is the worst I have ever had and I have only 
had two in twenty one (21) year. There is know reason that this company should 
not have a manual or how about a help button that really work. This is really 
funny I printed out a report but I for got were it was on the system. So I went 
to help and put in the name of the report and it said it was not there. If you 
have a question and need to call tech suport it will cost you a arm and a leg 
for the information were if you had a manaual or a help button that really work 
it would save you money.Overall ratingReview by Terri from Girl Scouts, 
Hornets' Nest Council | January 2012Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct quality
Customer supportOur organization is a non-profit organization, but has a 
specialized shop. Our shop hours are not normal retail and our customers are 
sometimes very demanding. Our inventory ranges from thousands of patches to 
clothing, jewelry, etc. We have used CounterPoint since 2005. Our shop 
previously had a cash register and the old source of look and order on 
inventory. In 2005 the shop was handed over to new management, who researched 
and concluded to use CounterPoint. I have been at this shop for over two years 
and transferred from another shop that also used CounterPoint. We had version 
7.5 until this past August and we upgraded to SQL. Version 7 was great to work 
with but SQL is so much more... We are able to resource more reports than 
before, with the ease of being able to have the help menu available.

 The training of staff was so easy and quick to pickup. My staff and myself 
have had such a great time adapting to the new software. It is so easy to track 
inventory, sales, customers, and again the use of many new and different 
reports that help us on a daily basis. Our favorite is the 2 or 3 steps at the 
End of Day, with the older version there were so many steps and this is 1,2,3 
and complete. Our support team is highly professional and always answers our 
calls in a timely manner. We are also excited because we do not HAVE to call 
them as much now with the new SQL. I would highly recommend CounterPoint to 
anyone who asks.Overall ratingReview by Shelley from Romence Gardens Inc | 
January 2012Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportWe are a 
retail garden center. We sell trees, shrubs, perennials, roses, birdseed 
feeders, grass seed, fertilizer, insecticide, fungicide, lawn and garden 
ornaments. We are open all year. It is a family owned and operated store in 
business for 109 years. We looked at software to run our inventory about 6 
years ago. We settled on CounterPoint because of it ease of use and great 
function ability. Before CounterPoint we used a general cash register without 
UPC scanning capability.

 One of the main reasons we like it is for the great support we get from 
Randall Data Systems, the company that implemented the system. We have a huge 
inventory so the implementation took a few months. Karen, from Randall stuck 
tight with us throughout the whole implementation, and is available for every 
question we may have even now. She really knows her stuff!

 CounterPoint is very easy to use. I train new cashiers and they catch on 
quickly. Even the ones with no computer experience, although it does help if 
they have some. We are now able to see our inventory with the click of a 
button. We know when to reorder inventory and what we may have in back stock. 
We also now know the profit margin on everything we sell. We never knew this 
before.

 I truly recommend this software to everyone.Overall ratingReview by Sarah from
North Arkansas Guns, Inc. | September 2011Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct 
qualityCustomer supportWe are a retailer of firearms and just found out we are 
the first guinea pigs to use Counterpoint SQL 8.4.3. Since firearms are a 
regulated industry, they are always serialized. We purchased the bound book 
module to facilitate tracking the acquisition & disposition of firearms. In 
general, I do not find the system intuitive from a laypersons perspective. I 
can ring up a sale. However, receiving trade-ins on guns doesn't work.

 We can't take consignments. Serial #s are missing from the bound book table. 
Our VAR is too overwhelmed to speak to us for entire days, bringing our 
business to a standstill. There is a substantial list of fixes that have been 
submitted to the programmers, and no timetable has been given for when they 
will be completed. Meanwhile, our business is limping along.

 Software is supposed to make your life easier, so you can run your business. 
It has made our life harder, and we are losing business because we are spending 
so much time dealing with constant problems with the system. I have to 
hand-write labels for our firearms because the software cannot accommodate what 
we need to print on the label. We have paid about $30K for a system that we are 
totally frustrated with, and no one will get back to us as to when things will 
be fixed.Overall ratingReview by Sean from Hi-Time Wine Cellars | September 2011
Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportMy Company recently made 
the switch to CounterPoint Enterprise SQL 8.4 and would like to share my 
experience with Radiant Systems. We have been in business for over 50 years and 
have had several different POS systems and CounterPoint has been the best 
system by far. Implementing a new system is never easy but with the help of 
OneStep Retail Solutions this has been the easiest and the quickest 
implementation I have ever done.

 There are so many POS systems on the market finding the best fit for your 
business is a very difficult decision. Kevin McAdams and Jay Shore with OneStep 
Retail Solutions took the time to learn our business needs and recommended 
CounterPoint as the best solution. After using the system for over a month now 
I am glad I took their advice because this is a great system.

 The CounterPoint Gateway for processing credit cards is very fast. The touch 
screen terminals make ringing up customers quick and easy. The ability to 
customize searches and change the information displayed through the column 
designer makes looking up the information a breeze. The reporting is equally 
fast, flexible and easy to use for all of our staff members.

 Blythe Franks, our business analyst from OneStep Retail Solutions has played 
a key role in making this transition from our old system to CounterPoint. Her 
experience and knowledge of the product has made implementation and integration 
of the system quick and easy. With her insight we were able to customize 
CounterPoint to meet all of our business needs making our company more 
efficient than ever.

Overall ratingReview by Gary from Polo Gear, Inc. | August 2011Ease-of-use
FunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer supportWe have been using CounterPoint 
software for over 10 years. The solution serves the retail environment well - 
it is easy to use and easy to teach new staff to use. Radiant has continued to 
develop it to meet the new world of Internet sales and marketing. I love the 
fact that our online store integrates into our retail database. As a result, we 
only have to worry about one set of data that updates to our website with two 
easy clicks.

 I also have to say that customer service is very good. Our CounterPoint reps, 
Sandy and Kevin, are super. Sabrina helps us maintain, develop and keep up our 
website, and she is terrific. They are responsive and helpful, and really try 
to help us understand and solve problems. The online help portal is also good, 
and teaches as well as solves problems.

 Overall, I would recommend CounterPoint to those who need a point of sale 
system, and/or Internet software that is very sophisticated in capability, but 
remains easy to use.Overall ratingReview by Greg from Lighthouse Marine 
Distributors | August 2011Ease-of-useFunctionalityProduct qualityCustomer 
supportWe operate a marine wholesale distributorship, along with a retail 
operation. Our three sources of revenue are store traffic, phone orders and 
Internet orders.

 Our previous software system, while specific to the marine industry and 
bundled with features we sorely miss, was unable to integrate e-commerce, point 
of sale, and shipping functionality. The time we spent dealing with each order 
on three different levels was time-consuming, and also allowed for the 
introduction of errors.

 We are currently running version 8.3.9 of CounterPoint, but will be upgrading 
to 8.4 as soon as the season slows this fall. The implementation experience was 
choppy, to say the least, due to a reseller that wasn't up to speed on the 
software. This hiccup notwithstanding, we were able grasp the basics and run 
with it.

 We have been using CounterPoint for just under two years now and the 
watershed moment was when we switched partners nine months into the project. 
Our reseller's knowledge of the system and ability to teach us its 
functionality have allowed us to move forward at a rapid pace. The program is 
easy to use, and a common logic follows through the system so even when playing 
with new features, the desired result is easy to achieve.

 Our current partner could stand to be slightly more responsive, especially to 
issues I consider to be very basic requirements in a system of this size and 
power.

 We are currently 95% integrated with UPS WorldShip. The only thing holding us 
back from 100% integration is CounterPoint's inability to receive tracking 
numbers back from WorldShip without cumbersome export and import of data, or 
utilizing a third-party program. We are currently investigating CPOnline with 
the hope of having full vertical integration by January 1, 2012.

 So far, we have been able to streamline sales, shipping & purchasing with 
more good things to come!More Reviews »

Answer:  

Answer 

 If you're not the supervisor or in management, you have no business making 
business decisions. It's a trick question.
 What they want to know is how you delegated problems to the proper channels. 
They want to know If you contacted your higher-ups with the present dilemna and 
gave them a briefing on the situation.
 What you want to do is get the name of the person who has the problem, and 
his/her phone number. Call your supervisor and if he/she isn't there, leave a 
message about the situation and give the person's name and number. The customer 
will have to be patient because there's nothing you can do.
 You tell your co-workers about the situation, and let the next shift be aware 
of the situation as well. It's all about communication and delegation of 
authority in business. If you were hired to solve problems, then of course, 
tell them of your problem solving skills.  Every employee solves problems... 

 Let's say you're a retail associate and you sell faucets. A customer wants a 
faucet that's on display. You're completely out of them. A good way to solve 
the problem would be to call another store that has some and get one sent to 
you. You wouldn't delegate that problem to a "proper channel" because YOU are 
the proper channel.
Agreed - This is not a trick question. Basically, the interviewer wants to get 
an idea of your judgment and decision making skills as well as what factors you 
considered in your decision and whether or not you involved or consulted 
others. More and more, companies are looking for critical thinkers who use good 
judgment both for the Customer and the company. Contributors

 TurboTax Review 

TurboTax is the industry-leading online tax software. With a clean and 
logical design, comprehensive deduction discovery tools, and thorough learning 
resources, TurboTax is a great selection for both simple and complex tax 
scenarios.File Your Taxes 

By Andrew Poulos

   
  
 updated on March 28, 2013 Tweet
  The Good

Strong overall design: Unlike some competitor products, TurboTax gives you 
the impression that the product is specifically designed for completing your 
taxes online in the most efficient manner. Interfaces are clean and intuitive, 
and processes have a very logical flow. This strong design enables those who 
are unfamiliar with online taxes to be comfortable and confident throughout the 
preparation and filing processes. This characteristic makes TurboTax a great 
choice for someone who is new to filing taxes online. Comprehensive learning 
resources: When it comes to learning resources, TurboTax is leading the 
industry. If you’re interested in getting more comfortable with the tax filing 
process, or if you simply prefer to find your own answers, TurboTax helps 
facilitate both by providing a thorough knowledge base, forum, glossary, and 
video tutorials. Featured at the bottom of most pages is a link to the TurboTax 
Community and a short list of previously asked questions. The TurboTax 
Community is made up of thousands of questions and answers. You can search the 
community for previously asked questions, or ask a question of your own. 
Autonomy throughout the system: TurboTax provides a high level of autonomy 
throughout the tax filing process. For example, based upon your answers to 
early setup questions, TurboTax automatically identifies sections that might 
impact your tax situation and presents them in a section titled “Other Tax 
Situations.” Instead of forcing you to work through these sections in a 
specific order, you can choose what to work on, and do it in the order you 
want. The section that identifies deductions and credits operates in a similar 
manner. Audit risk identification: TurboTax provides an audit risk meter that 
provides a visual warning to sections of your taxes that have the potential to 
trigger an audit. When possible, TurboTax will then provide guidance to correct 
these errors, helping you avoid an unnecessary audit. Superior deduction 
discovery: TurboTax provides resources to help discover a variety of deductions 
associated with your home, family, running a small business, owning rental 
properties, education, charitable donations, and more. TurboTax allows you to 
explore these options on your own, or you can utilize EasyGuides that will help 
walk you through each relevant deduction. Professional phone assistance: In 
addition to having representatives trained to answer general questions, 
TurboTax support includes licensed enrolled agents, certified public 
accountants, and tax attorneys that are contracted by Intuit to offer 
professional assistance. Having the ability to access professional support by 
telephone is an excellent resource. Military edition: TurboTax provides a 
military edition of the software that is catered specifically to the needs of 
those in the armed services. Pricing discounts are available, and items like 
basic pay, combat pay, uniform deductions, and other military-specific needs 
are all addressed. The Bad

Pricing is high: TurboTax is the most feature-rich and highly functional 
online tax software in the industry, and as the old adage goes, you get what 
you pay for. Whether you are filing with the Federal Free, Basic, Deluxe, 
Premier, or Home & Business Edition, chances are you will be paying more with 
TurboTax than you will with the competitor’s comparable edition. However, when 
you consider how much money a superior product like TurboTax can save you, the 
relatively higher prices might not seem like such a big deal. Character 
limitations in notes: TurboTax has a strong bookmarking system built into the 
software. It allows you to flag potential problem areas, enter a title and 
notes, and easily return to them through a Flags icon found in the main menu 
across the top of the screen. Although the system works well, the notes section 
of the flag is limited to very few characters. If a problem needed a little 
explanation, the flagging system wouldn’t be that useful. No retail locations: 
A few competing online tax software products are developed by companies that 
also maintain retail locations. In the event that you run into complex issues 
and are struggling to get your questions answered online, knowing that you can 
walk into a retail location and get additional assistance is a nice 
convenience. You may have to pay for this in-store assistance, but in order to 
get certain problems solved, face-to-face support can be the most efficient. 
TurboTax is not in the retail business and does not have stores that provide a 
service of this nature. TurboTax is recommended for

 [edit 

] History

Maxima is based on a 1982 version of Macsyma 
, which was developed at MIT 
 with funding from the United States 
Department of Energy 
 and other 
government agencies. A version ofMacsyma  
was maintained byBill Schelter  
from 1982 until his death in 2001. In 1998, Schelter obtained permission from 
the Department of Energy to release his version under the GPL. That version, 
now called Maxima, is maintained by an independent group of users and 
developers. Maxima does not include any of the many modifications and 
enhancements made to the commercial version ofMacsyma 
 during 1982–1999. Though the core 
functionality remains similar, code depending on these enhancements may not 
work on Maxima, and bugs which were fixed in Macsyma may still be present in 
Maxima, and vice-versa.

[edit 

] Features

Maxima includes a complete programming language with ALGOL 
-like syntax but Lisp-like semantics. It is 
written inCommon Lisp , and can be 
accessed programmatically and extended, as the underlying Lisp can be called 
from Maxima. It usesGnuplot  for drawing.

[edit 

] Numeric calculations

Maxima is a full-featured CAS (computer algebra system 
) that specializes in 
symbolic operations  but it 
also offers numerical capabilities[1] 
 such as 
arbitrary-precision arithmetic 
: integers 
 and rational numbers 
 which can grow to sizes limited 
only by machine memory, andfloating point numbers 
 whose precision can be set 
arbitrarily large ("bfloats").

For calculations which use floating point and arrays heavily, Maxima offers 
the possibility of generating code in other programming languages (notably
Fortran ) which may execute more 
efficiently.

Maxima is a general-purpose system, and special-case calculations such as 
factorization of large numbers, manipulation of extremely large polynomials,etc.
 are sometimes better done in specialized systems.

[edit 

] Examples

Simple equation solving:

 solve(x^2 = 1); which gives:

 [x = -1, x = 1] Solving a quadratic:

 a*x^2+b*x+c=0; solve(%, x); which gives the quadratic formula:

 [x=-(sqrt(b^2-4*a*c)+b)/(2*a),x=(sqrt(b^2-4*a*c)-b)/(2*a)] Solving a cubic 
(solution too large to include here):

 a*x^3+b*x^2+c*x+d=0; solve(%, x); Solving a quartic (solution too large to 
include here):

 a*x^4+b*x^3+c*x^2+d*x+e=0; solve(%, x); The first 32 rows of Pascal's 
triangle  (beginning with row 
zero ) may be calculated with

 makelist(makelist(binomial(n, i), i, 0, n), n, 0, 31); [edit 

] Interfaces

Various graphical user interfaces 
 are available for 
Maxima.wxMaxima is a popular cross-platform GUI using wxWidgets 
. Starting with version 4.4 
, the KDE 
Software Compilation  
containsCantor  – which can 
interface with Maxima (along withSage 
, R 
, and Kalgebra 
).[2] 
 The GNU 
 TeXmacs 
 and LyX 
 mathematical editor programs can be used to 
provide an interactive GUI for Maxima, as can Sage. Other options include the
Imaxima front end, as well as an Emacs  and 
Xemacs  interaction mode which is 
activated byImaxima.

 Abstract

IT is evolving rapidly, and the retail industry is looking at how it can 
improve business. Retailers are facing the challenge of how best to meet the 
need of an increasingly demanding customer base, while reducing the overall 
costs. In addition to meeting customer demands, retailers are facing the 
challenges of integrating their various functionalities and channels, which are 
mostly run as silos.

One of the emerging trends in the technology space is something known as 
Software as a Service (SaaS). This paper provides an overview of different 
architectures, their pros and cons, and the key technologies that are 
reinventing the centralized architecture now known as Software as a Service.

 Introduction

The retail industry is known to lag behind other industries in adopting new 
technology. One of the major reasons is the razor-thin margins with which 
retailers work, which demand the quick return on investment (ROI) that are 
usually granted only by established technologies and methodologies

Looking back, the evolution of retail architecture has thus followed what 
happened in other industrial sectors, moving from mainframe-based centralized 
architecture towards a departmental architecture where mini and personal 
computers brought data processing inside the stores. However, this shift 
created the new problem of data exchange with corporate systems. The evolution 
continued with client-server and then distributed architectures and now is 
evolving towards service-oriented architecture (SOA). Also, new concepts like
Software as a Service (SaaS) 
, which are 
achieving considerable success in the customer-relations management (CRM) 
sector, are not present yet in the store applications; but the situation is 
changing. This paper will provide an overview of SaaS and applicable 
technologies and their benefits to the retail industry.

 Business Challenges

Retail presents some peculiar challenges. Inside the store, there are two 
very distinct software functions: the store front, which is the "public" part 
devoted to check out that accesses data on products, customers, promotions, and 
so on; and the store back-office or "private" part of the store systems, for 
stock management, replenishment, reporting, labor scheduling, and inventory 
management. In some really small-footprint stores, both functions are carried 
out on the same physical computer, but they remain very distinct in nature.

 Point-of-Sale Transactions

In retail, the point-of-sale (POS) transactions are extremely important, yet 
have unique issues when compared to similar transactions in the B2B world. An 
obvious question is: Why is the problem of a delay in issuing a small valued 
ticket (due to a hardware or software failure, or just slow response time) so 
critical? The same problem for higher-valued invoices in a B2B transaction 
creates a limited problem, to the extent that it is not even noticed. The 
reason for this is twofold:


 * Stores make their profits from a high number of low-value transactions, 
usually concentrated in part of the day or part of the week and the check-out 
operations cannot be delayed during these times. 
 * A POS interruption, even for a limited time, may cause not only significant 
economic losses but, even more important, losses of customers gained with 
expensive and long effort. The bottom line is that POS is more mission-critical 
than the back office. POS must function at all times, irrespective of 
connectivity in the store, whereas back-office functions can wait for the 
connectivity to comeback. It also points to the possibility of back-office 
functions running either inside the store or provided by a service providers 
over the Internet.

 The Distributed vs. Centralized Architecture Dilemma

Outside the store, there are many centralized activities, such as logistics, 
marketing, bookkeeping, and so on. The efficiency of the retail activity 
depends on quantity and quality of data flow inside and outside the store. 
Software architectural choices are very important and difficult, because 
reliability and data sharing are conflicting factors.

Traditionally, POS systems are autonomous systems that exchange flat files in 
batch mode with back-office systems for stock management and reporting. In the 
same offline mode and after a role change, the back-office system exchanges 
sales and item data with corporate systems and other partners. This is defined 
asdistributed architecture where operations are supported by a local database, 
so that no external failure can stop such vital operations.

The distributed architecture has a reliability and scalability advantage 
because it has no single point of failure and processing is distributed, but 
requires a complex synchronization activity among autonomous systems with their 
own databases and an expensive deployment. Store-sales information must be 
uploaded to the corporate systems and item and promotion information must be 
downloaded to the store systems. In addition, deployment of new applications, 
patches, and updates is not easy. There is also the issue of monitoring systems 
at the stores to ensure that the critical systems are functioning normally at 
all times.

 

Figure 2. Distributed architecture (Click on the picture for a larger image)

In the centralized architecture, the store front-end systems (POS terminals, 
self service kiosks, and so forth) are connected online to the store server 
over a network and exchange sales information in real time. In the same way, 
the store back-office systems can be connected online to the corporate systems 
for exchanging sales and item information. Permanent connection over a network 
makes richer data available, such as a customer's previous transactions, 
specific promotions, real-time loyalty-points management, stock availability, 
and next delivery date.

A centralized architecture with a single database solves the synchronization 
problem, but introduces a single point of failure and scalability limit, both 
inside the store for POS management and outside for connection to corporate 
systems. The central server failure or a network failure stops the business 
completely, with very serious consequences.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to achieve the advantages of the 
distributed architecture (such as reliability and scalability) without the 
burden of database synchronization. Many organizations that need services given 
only by an online access to centralized data, being on the store or in the HQ, 
use redundant servers and connections or emergency operations, but at higher 
costs and complexity.

When data exchanges among autonomous and heterogeneous systems are performed 
through flat files, eventually with some "impedance-mismatch" problems or even 
with some data loss, the architecture is defined asdepartmental.

When the data exchange among subsystems is performed by design with maximum 
fidelity, no data loss, and automatic updates, the architecture is defined as
distributed. Sometimes, the term "distributed architecture" is used for "grid 
computing," the sharing of resources through a network of generic computers 
arranged to create a virtual super computer. In our case, the term 
"distributed" is used just to emphasize a high integration level among 
subsystems obtained at the application level, and not at the operating system 
level.

Only recently have the big enterprise resource planning (ERP) players offered 
vertical solutions for retail—always deriving from acquisitions and after some 
efforts on user interface (UI), business rules, and data integration. The 
majority of retail systems in use today are situated in the spectrum from 
departmental to distributed architectures, with a gradual migration from the 
first to the second.

 

Figure 3. Centralized architecture (Click on the picture for a larger image)

 Client-Server Architecture

In the client-server architecture—as the name implies—the client asks for 
some service, which the server will fulfill. The client-server architecture 
represented an improvement over centralized architecture, because presentation 
and user-interaction functions are transferred from the server to the 
client—normally, on a PC with a processing power much higher than the old green 
terminals. This reduces the load on the server and leads to an improved system 
scalability and responsiveness to the user. However, it does not solve the 
"single-point-of-failure" issue.

In the retail industry, the client-server architecture is used more often 
inside the store—connecting POS to the back of the store—and less outside using 
a unique centralized server for an entire chain of stores.

 Centralized-Architecture Revival

With the increasing availability of high-speed Internet connections, 
centralized architecture is gaining new life, not with old mainframes and green 
screens, but with modern and rich graphical user experience through Windows 
Terminal Server from Microsoft, similar products from Citrix, or browser-based 
applications. Also client-server applications, which depend heavily on the 
connectivity, received a huge boost due to the widespread availability of 
virtual private networks (VPN).

The application software providers (ASP) of 10 years ago were based on a 
centralized architecture in which data, business logic, presentation, and user 
interfaces resided in a data center—leaving in-store personal computers 
underutilized.

ASPs offered solutions that provided following advantages: 


 * No upfront licensing costs 
 * No deployment hassles 
 * Can be accessed from anywhere 
 * Promised around-the-clock availability However, some of these promises did 
not really materialize, such as the around-the-clock availability, as there 
were outages at the ASPs. The user experience suffered also from bad response 
time when the low scalability of the architecture added up with Internet 
latency. Therefore, the first generation of ASP solutions did not achieve much 
success, due to their limited improvements, compared to traditional software. 
The correct way would have been to redesign the applications for providing 
service over the Internet, which requires completely different thinking.

In the retail industry, the success of ASP-based solutions was even lower, 
because the mission-critical nature of POS operations demands availability of 
service and local data even during the loss of connectivity. In other words, 
offline operations are critical in retail from both business and psychological 
points of view.

 Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Real-time connectivity among store systems, corporate systems, supplier 
systems, logistics, and other service providers through the Internet is a great 
condition that all retailers strive for. Extensive research has been devoted to 
overcome the limitations of terminal- or browser-based solutions.

AJAX and other rich Internet application (RIA) technologies are an answer to 
real-time connectivity and responsiveness. However, they are not a solution for 
a POS where only a local application with a local database can provide the 
necessary functionality and availability.

To meet this need, there is a new model—based on XML and Web services—that is 
delivering rich services from an array of heterogeneous applications in a 
distributed architecture. Service orientation (SO) is the natural evolution of 
current development models. The 1980s saw the object-oriented models; then, 
there was the component-based development model in the 1990s; and, now, we have 
service orientation. Service orientation retains the benefits of 
component-based development (self-description, encapsulation, dynamic 
discovery, and loading), but there is a shift in paradigm from remotely 
invoking methods on objects, to one of passing messages among services. Schemas 
describe not only the structure of messages, but also behavioral contracts to 
define acceptable message-exchange patterns and policies to define service 
semantics. This promotes interoperability and, thus, provides adaptability 
benefits, as messages can be sent from one service to another without 
considering how the service handling those messages has been implemented.

 

Figure 4. SOA architecture (Click on the picture for a larger image)

Service orientation provides an evolutionary approach to building distributed 
software that facilitates loosely coupled integration with its inherent 
scalability and resilience. With the advent of the WS-* specifications, Web 
services architecture has made service-oriented software development feasible 
by virtue of mainstream development tools support and broad industry 
interoperability. Although most frequently implemented using industry-standard 
Web services, service orientation is independent of technology and its 
architectural patterns, and can be used to connect with legacy systems, too.

Unfortunately, the benefits offered by service orientation and SOA have been 
obscured by the hype and confusion that increasingly surround the terms. As 
awareness and excitement around SOA have swelled, the clear lines that once 
defined service orientation have been blurred. However SO does offer some 
specific benefits when used for the right purpose.

To increase SOA systems scalability, the service should be as stateless as 
possible. Not having to lookup the client's state from the previous interaction 
conserves CPU resources. In addition, the coupling between service users and 
providers should be as loose as possible or, in other words, asynchronous. 
Compared to traditional client-server architectures (in which each client waits 
idly for its turn to be served), in SOA architectures, the client usually 
switches to other tasks while waiting for the answer.

 Smart Client

When an application exhibits the following properties, it is called a smart 
client and has the following characteristics: 


 * Utilizes local resources (CPU, GPU, and so on) 
 * Consumes Web services 
 * Operates online/offline where appropriate 
 * Intelligent deployment/update 

Figure 5. Smart-client properties

Close examination of these characteristics reveals that these are the same 
requirements as a POS application.

On the other side, as store's back-office functions are less critical and 
can, therefore, be designed to work only when connected to the centralized 
systems, a rich AJAX-based client can be a good choice. But, especially with 
complex applications, there are many benefits of smart clients. They marry the 
best of the Web with the best of Windows, lower operation and development costs 
(especially when offline capabilities are limited), increase user experience 
and satisfaction, and align with future technology. Moreover, they can be 
easily deployed with ClickOnce, where the cost is as low as browser-based 
solutions.

 Software as a Service

Service orientation brings many benefits with it in building agile, 
configurable, and scalable services. The loosely coupled benefit of SO helps in 
building a centralized service that can be easily configured, can scale based 
on the use, and can support multitenancy.

When a service is being built to support many customer needs, it is best to 
consider building it as configurable and scalable service that uses metadata to 
provide different experiences to customers. A centralized service that can 
support many customers with different requirements through metadata-based 
configuration is defined "multitenant" and offers the best ROI, because it can 
provide different experiences to different customers through configuration, 
reducing the cost of infrastructure. Using a housing metaphor, a multitenant 
system is comparable to a block where a number of different flats share land, 
stairs, roof, and so on.

A single instance of service that can serve multiple customers over the 
Internet is now known as Software as a Service (SaaS) and can be broadly 
defined as "software deployed as a hosted service and accessed over the 
Internet." SaaS is going to have a major impact on the software industry, 
because it will change the way in which people build, sell, buy, and use 
software. For this to happen, however, software vendors need resources and 
information about developing SaaS applications effectively.

SaaS as a concept is often associated with the ASPs of the 1990s, which 
provided "shrink-wrap" applications to business users over the Internet. As 
mentioned previously, in some ways, these early attempts at Internet-delivered 
software had more in common with traditional on-premise applications than with 
modern SaaS applications, such as licensing and architecture. Because these 
applications were originally built as single-tenant applications, their ability 
to share data and processes with other applications was limited, and they 
tended to offer few economic benefits over their locally installed 
counterparts. Today, SaaS applications are expected to take advantage of the 
benefits of centralization through a single-instance, multitenant architecture, 
and to provide a feature-rich experience competitive with comparable on-premise 
applications. A typical SaaS application is offered either directly by the 
vendor or by an intermediary party called an aggregator, which bundles SaaS 
offerings from different vendors and offers them as part of a unified 
application platform.

On the technical side, the SaaS provider hosts the application and data 
centrally—deploying patches and upgrades to the application transparently, and 
delivering access to end users over the Internet through a browser or 
smart-client application. Many vendors provide application programming 
interfaces (API) that expose the applications' data and functionality to 
developers for use in creating composite applications. A variety of security 
mechanisms can be used to keep sensitive data safe in transmission and storage. 
Applications providers might provide tools that allow customers to modify the 
data schema, workflow, and other aspects of the application's operation for 
their use. Figure 6 shows a sample SaaS architecture.



Figure 6. Sample SaaS architecture

SaaS can include a number of services and applications that are not commonly 
expected to be found in this category. For example, consider Web-based e-mail 
services, such as Microsoft Hotmail. Although Hotmail might not be the first 
example that comes to mind when you think of SaaS, it meets all of the basic 
criteria: A vendor hosts all of the program logic and data, and provides end 
users with access to this data over the public Internet, through a Web-based 
user interface.

Moving from the general to specific, we can identify two major categories of 
SaaS:


 * Line-of-business services (LOB) offered to enterprises and organizations of 
all sizes—LOB services are often large, customizable business solutions aimed 
at facilitating business processes, such as finances, supply-chain management, 
and customer relations. Typically, these services are sold to customers on a 
subscription basis. 
 * Consumer-oriented services offered to the general public—Consumer-oriented 
services are sometimes sold on a subscription basis, but often are provided to 
consumers at no cost, and are supported by advertising. In retail, there are 
many opportunities in the LOB category, such as back-office 
inventory-management applications, payment-processing applications, reporting 
services, and so on. We cover this in more depth in the following section.

SaaS Benefits in Retail

SOA and SaaS concepts allow important cost reductions to better serve 
existing markets and open entirely new ones. With his article "The Long Tail," 
in the October 2004 issue ofWired (see the References 
 
section), Chris Anderson popularized the idea of the "long tail" in explaining 
why online retailers such as Amazon.com are uniquely positioned to fill a huge 
demand that traditional retailers cannot serve cost-effectively.

Retail follows the famous 80/20 rule: The most popular merchandise (which is 
usually 20 percent) is bought by 80 percent of the customers. So, retailers are 
forced to decide whether to carry the remaining 80 percent of non-popular 
merchandise in the store or carry more of the popular merchandise. The 
traditional "brick-and-mortar" retailers concentrate on selling the more 
popular items, because they cannot possibly stock non-popular merchandise. 
Online retailers, however, do not have to worry about limited shelf space. 
Shipping items to customers directly from large warehouses around the world, 
they can advertise and sell the millionth most popular title as easily as the 
most popular one. Access to this long tail of low-volume sales translates into 
a huge amount of revenue.

So, what does this have to do with SaaS? Retailers face several challenges 
when they evaluate software to run their businesses:


 * Upfront investment—The cost of the central system is usually not directly 
proportional to the number of stores, weighing more on small or new chains. 
 * Deployment cost—Traditional software must be installed and maintained by 
competent technicians traveling from store to store with high cost and limited 
peak capacity. Also, remote maintenance over the Internet is usually done one 
store at a time. 
 * Technical competence—Successful retailers are usually more competent on 
customer needs and products/services than on IT operations. 
 * Data-sharing difficulties—It is quite easy to share data with HQ, but 
complex to do with third parties—such as independent logistics, product 
catalogues, and market analysis—or when exchanging customer data with other 
non-competing chains for joint-loyalty programs. 
 * Cost of new software-feature implementation—The new feature, even if 
already available, must be bought and deployed over some test stores. If 
acceptable, the general deployment cannot be immediate. What SaaS offers is an 
opportunity to provide customized services to many small customers using a 
single platform, which cannot be accomplished through traditional means. A 
widely known example of SaaS is SalesForce.Com, which is able to offer CRM 
capabilities to many customers over the Internet using a single system. This 
ability to offer functionality to multiple tenants is the biggest advantage of 
SaaS.

There are many other areas in which retailers can benefit from SaaS 
applications. For example, a retail enterprise, switching from old systems to a 
SaaS POS integrated with their ERP, allows the implementation of very 
sophisticated and new fidelity initiatives, so they can securely share data 
with other non-competing chains through centralized retail Web services. New 
features can be tried and adopted only when they fit the business model and the 
customer composition, without any spike in internal IT effort or risk. Because 
of this, with SaaS, an independent store can use the same software as the large 
enterprise retailer—eventually, using it in more creative and effective ways.

There is one key difference in the process of how traditional software is 
sold, deployed, and used compared to SaaS-based applications. Selling SaaS is 
like selling mobile-phone ringtones or downloadable music: It should be 
possible for a customer to visit a SaaS provider's site, subscribe to the 
service, pay with a credit card, customize the service, and begin using it—all 
without human intervention on the part of the service provider. This does not 
mean that a more personal approach is completely eliminated. It can still be 
used for larger retailers with more extensive needs. But designing the sales, 
marketing, provisioning, and customization processes from the ground up to work 
automatically makes it possible to offer an automated approach as a choice; 
also, it has the happy side effect of simplifying the work that the support 
personnel of the service provider must perform to accomplish the same tasks on 
behalf of a customer.

Figure 7 shows the SaaS maturity model as mentioned in the SaaS paper (see the
References 
 
section). According to this model, as soon as the services architecture is 
achieved, some of the services can be outsourced to a SaaS-based service 
provider over the Internet. In this retail-based example, the fourth model 
shows that the end-user application is composed of services—some of which are 
hosted internally and some of which are provided by the SaaS-based service 
provider. This composition layer can be realized using either an AJAX-based 
thin client or a smart client. The selection should be based on the business 
function and requirements for up time.

 

Figure 7. SaaS maturity model (Click on the picture for a larger image)

If a retailer decides to use SaaS-based POS, the best option is to be 
smart-client–based, which can be easily deployed over the Internet. Local 
databases must be synchronized, but the effort is paid back with increased 
reliability and scalability.

Compared to traditional offline POS, a smart-client–based one exploits fully 
the online connectivity to central resources offering additional services and 
work offline only when connectivity is temporarily lost—and, therefore, will 
not upset the delicate POS transactions, as customers will not be affected if 
the service goes offline, whereas a traditional offline POS performs always in 
the lowest mode.

In retail, the availability demand for back-office applications is lower than 
for front-office and, thus, can be based on Web 2.0 technologies, such as AJAX 
and Windows Presentation Foundation/Everywhere (WPF/E); but, for complex 
applications, a smart client offers a more robust and optimized development 
environment.

 Key Microsoft Technologies

Key Microsoft technologies that help in realizing this architecture start 
with Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and 
Windows Workflow Foundation (WF). These two key components of .NET Framework 
3.0 help in creating Web services and workflows to realize this architecture. 
.NET Framework 3.0 is released, and it is available on both the Windows Vista 
and Microsoft Windows XP platforms.

Some of the other technologies are highlighted in this section.

ClickOnce

ClickOnce is a technology for application delivery and maintenance over the 
Internet in a simple and secure way. The application package can be published 
on a Web site and installed through a Web page. A ClickOnce application can 
operate on the workstation in isolated mode, protecting it from incompatibility 
and reliability problems that may arise when a new application is installed on 
an already working system.

Initial installation and subsequent updates happen only after verification of 
the software maker and without administrative credentials from the user, 
increasing the trust and acceptance of this technology. These and other 
features reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO) for the user and allow the 
developer to distribute the smart-client application to thousands of 
workstations with small effort.

SQL Server 2005

Central Web services and local smart clients are based on the Microsoft SQL 
Server family of databases. SQL Server 2005 is used on the central retail Web 
services where native XML data management is very useful, along with advanced 
maintenance and storage services. SQL Server Express is used on smart clients, 
because it is equally feature-rich, but lighter and installable through 
ClickOnce.

Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)

WCF is the new unified programming model for communications. It has complete 
flexibility of:


 * Transport. 
 * Encoding. 
 * Message-exchange pattern. 
 * Security. WCF provides a unified software layer for exchanging data with 
every standard platform and in any condition. Security is very important, and 
WCF assures integrity and confidentiality of data exchanged with the retail Web 
services. WCF also increases the reliability and efficiency of the available 
channel.

 

Figure 8. WCF architecture (Click on the picture for a larger image)

Store back-office applications can be linked to the retail Web services 
through a WCF HTTP channel supporting WS-* specifications, to make it 
interoperable with non-Windows applications. Alternatively, WCF makes available 
a high-performance channel based on TCP—fully exploiting improvements in the 
.NET Framework 3.0. Store back-office applications can automatically select the 
best protocol for the available channel; and, inside the store, WCF allows a 
peer-to-peer cooperation among the workstations.

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

Another power technology is the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). WPF is 
the new user-experience platform, and is part of .NET Framework 3.0 for 
building highly interactive and sophisticated user interfaces that provided a 
rich experience to users that was previously difficult with Windows Forms.

 

Figure 9. WPF architecture (Click on the picture for a larger image)

WPF solves this difficult problem and makes it very easy to build graphically 
rich user experiences for skilled and unskilled users. Also, with WPF, it is 
possible for the first time for interaction designers and programmers to 
cooperate using the new language, known as Extensible Application Markup 
Language (XAML, pronounced "zammel"). XAML is a declarative XML-based language 
that is used to define objects and their properties, relationships, and 
interactions. XAML is used also as a user-interface markup language to define 
UI elements, data binding, eventing, and other features, as well as in WF, in 
which workflows themselves can be defined using XAML.

 Conclusion

The IT industry is going through a major change and technology is enabling 
this disruption. The lowering cost of bandwidth, the availability of computing 
in new and cheaper forms factors and devices, and the increases in productivity 
and usability have caused a massive growth in services over the Internet. The 
retail industry, which operates on razor-thin margins, can certainly take 
advantage of these services to reduce overall cost and enhance services. 
Microsoft technologies play a key role in enabling retailers to take advantage 
of this new paradigm.

Selling Solutions Solve Shopper Problems

Shopping online poses unique challenges for shoppers.  One shopper’s 
challenge may involve narrowing down choices while another shopper’s may be 
identifying what particular product may solve their problem.  Unlike shopping 
at a brick-and-mortar store, eCommerce retailers cannot rely on knowledgeable 
salespeople to guide a shopper to the best product suitable for their needs. 

eCommerce retailers, however, have eCommerce guided selling solutions 
available to create a better online shopping experience for customers.  
Depending on the complexity of products offered, retailers may choose one 
online assisted selling tool over another. 

Identifying the best guided selling software starts with the identification 
of a shopper’s problem. 

Shopper Problem: I Can’t Make a Choice


 Shopping online can be an overwhelming experience for a customer.  When 
presented with hundreds of closely related products, a customer may become 
confused and even frustrated. 

To help customers narrow down results, retailers can employ product search 
tools that can assist customers in filtering choices based on product-specific 
attributes.  Such an example is an eCommerce product advisor. By asking 
shoppers questions or providing them with useful filters, the product finder 
software delivers real-time recommendations that match the shopper’s needs. 

Shopper Problem: I Have Don’t Know What Product I Need

  
 When it comes to more complex products, shoppers may not readily know what 
type of product best will solve their problem or fit their needs.  This is 
perhaps the biggest hurdle that retailers face when trying to create useful 
online assisted selling. 

In this case, an eCommerce product configurator acts as a consultative tool 
for the shopper by mimicking the experienced salesperson.  In this version of 
eCommerce assisted selling, the guided selling software focuses on usage and/or 
lifestyle questions to identify and match products that can solve the shopper’s 
problem.  Based on these answers, a shopper is then suggested a series of 
recommended products that can solve his/her problem. 

As we continue to move into the digital era, online shopping is replacing 
much of the traditional shopping.  While that’s good news for online retailers, 
it is also a warning sign that profits and success are based on the ability to 
accurately identify and resolve shoppers’ problems.  By providing a 
user-friendly and intuitive approach, eCommerce guided selling solutions help 
retailers not only solve shopper problems but also provide them with a unique 
and pleasurable shopping experience for increased customer loyalty and an 
increased lifetime value for each individual customer. 

iGoDigital’s toolbox includes interactive consulting tools, mobile guided 
selling apps and product advisors.  Learn more about iGoDigital’s guided 
selling solutions by requesting a demo or readingcase studies

Ben & Jerry’s website suffers “brain freeze” on Free Cone Day 


Photo: Flickr / internet_dairy 

Do you like ice cream? How about free ice cream? Would you like to find out 
where you can get a free scoop of Ben & Jerry’s as part of their annual “Free 
Scoop Day”?

Well, you’re not alone. In fact, so many people rushed to the Ben & Jerry’s 
website on Tuesday April 9th to use the “Scoop Shop Locator” in one go that, 
rather ironically, the site froze to a halt.

In an email, Ben & Jerry’s spokeswoman Kelly Mohr confirmed that the website 
went into meltdown due to “heavy traffic.” The site has since returned to being 
fully functional but the chance to get another free scoop will have to wait 
until 2014 – let’s hope the Vermont-based ice cream powerhouse is more prepared 
for the traffic next time around.

You have to wonder why the site was so popular. Did I mention the part about 
free ice cream, by the way?

 service, which helps mitigate the risk of traffic overwhelming high-profile 
sites such as theLondon Paralympics 
 and 
Stand Up To Cancer

Channel 4 & Intechnica present “Performance in CI” at London Web 
Performance Group 


 Packed 
house at News International

Continuous Performance Testing was the hot topic at the London Web 
Performance Group 
 of 20th 
March. Intechnica and Channel 4 were on hand to give a presentation 
highlighting the challenges around performance in CI to a packed room at the 
News International HQ.

In fact, it was “standing room only” as Andy Still 
 (Intechnica co-founder 
and Technical Director) kicked off the presentation by providing some 
background on performance in modern development approaches. He also addressed 
the debate on whether process or tooling is more inhibiting to this approach.

This was backed up by Mark Smith (Online QA Manager, Channel 4) who provided 
detailed technical insights to the recent “Scrapbook 
” project. Intechnica 
provided Channel 4 with a dedicated Performance consultant to oversee the 
performance and testing needs of the project to great success. Mark outlined 
the tools and processes implemented and the results achieved.

The presentation, hosted by News International, was well received by the 100+ 
attendees and sparked a spirited Q&A session afterwards. Comments in reviews on 
the Meetup.com site described the presentation as “great, insightful” and 
“excellent and useful”.

The presentation can be viewed on Slideshare 
 
now.

Web Performance Groups meet regularly in London and Manchester. If you are 
interested in attending a Web Performance Group meetup, you can join by

 and Manchester 
 branches.

Kraftwerk fans left fuming as Tate website fails to perform 


Fans of Kraftwerk made their displeasure heard loud and clear when the Tate 
Modern’s website crashed under heavy load, just as tickets went on sale for the 
synthpop band’s string of concerts at the London venue.

The band from Düsseldorf are set for eight “one-off” gigs in February at the 
Tate’s Turbine Hall. The gigs are being billed as a “chronological exploration 
of the group’s sonic and visual experiments” with “spectacular 3D 
visualisations and effects”.

Sadly many fans missed out, before lashing out at Tate Modern via Twitter and 
news sources – some even making their way to the iconic building itself to 
voice disappointment in the failed system and choked phone service.

We’re currently experiencing huge demand for #kraftwerk 
 tickets, please keep trying or try 
calling the ticketing line + 44 020 7887 4919—

These scenes should be familiar to anyone who tried to get Glastonbury tickets
this year 

, or indeed back in 2004 when theirwebsite fell over under the load 
. In fact it took an 
agonising 24 hours for the 100,000+ tickets to go, despite the huge demand on 
the day. Being made to wait for so long in telephone queues, or on slowly 
loading, bug-ridden or crashed websites, is a sure fire way to frustrate 
customers and create a PR nightmare.

However, the following year, tickets for Glastonbury 2005 sold out in less 
than 3 hours . This 
was down to an improvement in the software behind the system, which was 
developed by Intechnica’s Technical DirectorAndy Still 
.

“Under tests, the system was proven to be capable of processing 100,000 
transactions in about a minute without slowing down,” explained Andy. “It was 
thought that we should throttle it a bit though, to give people a fair chance 
to get tickets over at least a few hours.”

Intechnica recently launched the Event Performance Management 
 (EPM) 
service, which offers a complete solution to websites likely to receive huge 
peaks of traffic due to sales, new releases, media coverage or public interest. 
The service was used to ensureStand Up To Cancer 
 was able to 
successfully receive £6.5m in donations during one night of prime time TV 
without any website performance hiccups, as well as keepingAsos.com 
 fast and stable during the 
busy Christmas shopping period.

The secret of a successful product launch? Don’t let the website crash 


 A good online checkout should be like 
shopping in a supermarket with plenty of open tills. Photo – Flickr/nateOne 


Even when your warehouse’s shelves are stocked, your supply is directly 
proportional to your website’s availability, speed and performance. Your 
customer satisfaction levels also hit a glass ceiling when your website can’t 
cope with demand.

This morning, the Nexus 4 phone sold out in the UK through Google’s online 
Play Store in less than 30 minutes. However, buyers and would-be buyers alike 
reported website inconsistencies, errors, freeze-ups, slow-downs, failed 
transactions, mistaken duplicate transactions, and lack of purchase 
confirmation. And this is the renowned kings of web speed Google. So how do you 
keep a website up and customers happy when there’s such high demand?

Imagine a supermarket checkout area. Imagine queuing up, having your items 
scanned by a cashier, but before you can pay, the cashier starts serving the 
next person in the queue as soon as they arrive – then, if all the items you’re 
trying to buy sell out in the meantime, you’re not allowed to buy the item 
anymore and leave the shop empty handed.

All too often this is an accurate metaphor for buying high demand products 
online, and the problem is that these complicated systems need to be built with 
scale in mind.

A good online transaction should work more like a supermarket with plenty of 
checkouts open, where customers are served consistently, one at a time, first 
come first served.

Obviously there will be a lot of disappointment when demand naturally 
outstrips supply, such as when there are only 140,000 Glastonbury tickets or 
allegedly 30,000 Nexus 4 phones on sale, yet millions of people who want to buy 
one.

However, even without such restrictions or high levels of demand such as in 
the case of the Nexus 4, your supply is actually only as great as your 
website’s capacity to take orders. A crashed website means you’re not moving 
any stock whatsoever, and it’s left sitting in your warehouse, even where there 
is plenty of demand.

To make matters worse, transactional websites are very complex, meaning the 
chances are greater for the site to stumble or fall when a lot of people are 
using it at once – and people get anxious when payment details are involved, 
even if they succeed in buying your product – Anyone who tried to buy a Nexus 4 
on the first day can attest to that.

 Technology means we shouldn’t have 
to queue around the block for the latest gadgets. Photo – Flickr/dan taylor 
<http://blog.intechnica.co.uk/Technology means we shouldn't have to queue 
around the block for the latest gadgets>

It took a painful 24 hours for Glastonbury to sell out in 2004 and the 
experience lives on in the memories of those who suffered through it. Event 
organiser Michael Eavis was later quoted as saying “We can improve the 
software, definitely – but is it a good thing to sell them all out in one hour? 
We could have sold them out last night in five minutes, but is that a good 
thing? I don’t think it is you know, I’d rather string it out a bit.”

The software was indeed improved – fast forward to a year later and the same 
number of tickets went at a much swifter 3 hours. According to the man who 
built the system (and Intechnica co-founder) Andy Still, “Under testing, the 
system used for 2005?s Glastonbury ticket sales was capable of selling 100,000 
tickets in under a minute, but we throttled it to give people a wider window to 
buy their tickets in the interest of fairness.”

So is it possible to sell out quickly without your website falling over? Yes, 
but only when the system is designed to perform properly.

Why you can’t wait for 4G to speed up your retail site 


 

How can you make your site faster for mobile users?

On 30th October 2012, 4G was rolled out in the UK 

 to customers of mobile network EE.

4G, the fourth generation of mobile services, promises broadband-speed data 
connections for mobile devices.

For now this EE exclusive offering is very much a premium product, not only 
because of the pricing model and device restrictions, but also because it’s 
only available in 10 cities currently. This dramatically limits the number of 
people who can actually make use of the superfast speeds “on the go”.

Recently, eBay warned that the lack of speedy mobile shopping experiences 
could cost the UK economy £120m this Christmasaccording to an article on 
internetretailing.net 

, and this could have been avoided by more widespread 4G coverage and adoption 
– but is 4G really the “magic bullet” to cure sluggish, unresponsive online 
shopping experiences?

Retailers see increased network speeds as an opportunity to add more elements 
to pages, particularly on mobiles and tablets. But this doesn’t necessarily 
match up with the public’s expectations with site speed – the top barriers to 
mobile shopping success will still be down to speed and reliability.

Retailers should not make the mistake of waiting for 4G to solve the speed 
issue for them – they can see significant results right now, from desktop 
through to mobile site performance. A one second page delay can cause a 7% 
reduction on conversion rates, so taking a serious look at your site’s 
performance is well worthwhile.

We recently released our whitepaper “Faster Websites = More Revenue” for free 
download. It features a fantastic overview of why performance is important, 
clear advice on how to improve it for your own retail site and the potential 
gains to revenue you’ll see as a result.If you’d like a copy, click here to

Intechnica sponsor and get involved in first “Hack Manchester” 


 

Manchester-based digital agency Intechnica were involved in the highly 
successful Hack Manchester event at the Museum of Science and Industry this 
past weekend. As sponsors, Intechnica provided a challenge plus prizes to those 
taking part, with Technical Director Andy Still judging and handing out brand 
new Raspberry Pi computers to the winners.

As well as proudly sponsoring the event, Intechnica fielded a team to bravely 
stay up through the night and hack together a working product in 24 hours.



The finished, working product was a word search generator game using an SMS 
API, where players could text in words to be hidden in the grid before 
opponents text the hidden words back to solve the puzzle.

Hopefully Hack Manchester will become an annual event, continuing to showcase 
the talent of all the great teams taking part. The dedication of the 
organisers, volunteers and teams taking part was fantastic.

See you at the next Hack Manchester!

How (and Why) NOT to Crash Your Servers 


I recently came across a blog post on iMedia Connection titled “How to Crash 
Your Servers: 4 Key Elements to Driving Traffic 

“. This struck me as a strange title; after all, who would actually WANT to 
crash their own servers?

Well, I suppose the title worked because I clicked and I read the post. But 
as the title hints, the article opens with the “attractive” proposition of 
creating a marketing campaign so effective that it crashes the target website. 
In fact, here’s a direct quote:

“From my marketing experience at ZAGG, we’ve crashed the servers a number of 
times by using these four key elements of driving traffic to your website.”

I want to give this marketer the benefit of the doubt, especially because the 
rest of the article doesn’t really have anything to do with this misguided 
intro, but I was struck by two thoughts after reading:


 * The last thing your business should want to happen is for your website to 
crash or suffer performance problems.This is not a good thing! 
 * The worst possible time to direct people towards your website or landing 
page is when your website is down or at a crawl.It’s a waste of time and effort 
and annoys potential customers! Here’s another quote from the article: “It’s 
every internet marketers dream to crash the servers.” While it might seem like 
a great indicator of success that a marketing campaign has generated so much 
traffic that it “crashed the servers”, here’s the bad news: by sending more 
traffic at your site than the site could handle,you’ve just wasted your 
marketing campaign, since nobody can take advantage of your special offer or 
read about your business now that the site is unavailable.

Think about it: If you were a potential customer and you saw an offer online 
that you wanted to take advantage of, or an advert or link to a product or 
service that might be of genuine interest to you, how would you feel if you 
clicked that link only to sit looking at a loading screen for several minutes, 
or if the page just never loaded at all? MAYBE you would try again later. But 
you’re more likely to never come back – 88% of users don’t return to websites 
after a poor experience (source:Gomez 
). This also 
softens the impact of any future marketing campaigns you do. I think the most 
key fact to mention, though, is thata crashed website has a conversion rate of 
zero. Guaranteed.

So by bringing your website down with your brilliant marketing campaign, 
you’ve wasted marketing budget, damaged your brand, annoyed potential customers 
and lost revenue. Doesn’t seem like such a great goal any more, does it?

I’m not saying you should be conservative with your marketing campaigns in 
fear of bringing the website down. Instead, you need to know that your website 
will be able to handle the traffic brought in by marketing streams, before the 
campaign starts. By undertaking a performance audit withIntechnica 
, you 
can get assurance on exactly how much traffic your website can handle (see 
Janrain’s blog about their story 

), as well as where any performance problems might exist.

To see some real world examples of overzealous marketing campaigns being 
wasted by poorly performing or crashed websites, including Nectar, Dr Pepper 
and the Glastonbury festival, check out 15 Web Performance Nightmares, and the 
damage they caused

Specification by Example: Tooling Recommendations 


Specification by example has a history that is closely linked to Ruby. The 
main software tools and development methods came from work on Ruby projects. As 
the method has started to attract a wider audience development tools and links 
to Microsoft .Net platforms have begun to appear.

At Intechnica our approach has been from two directions. An important aspect 
of the methodology is the use of continuous integration and code build, and 
that unit tests and inter-module testing is built into the software framework. 
This will prove that the code providing the functionality for the stories is 
working properly. So the development teams are looking to build continuous 
integration and unit tests into their software development processes. At the 
same time we don’t want to be tied to a specific and expensive development 
platform. Current processes are predicated on using Team Foundation Server – if 
the testing components are added to this it becomes an expensive solution.

The area that the solution assurance team are working in is the setting out 
the scope of the project and ensuring that the requirements reflect customer 
business requirements. Most importantly, it is then taking that living 
documentation and collaborating with the development team, PM’s and the 
customer to refine the details and identify the key business flows. Initially 
the outline ideas are put together using whiteboard sessions. These are then 
recorded into a mind-map software solution. There are many different products 
out there – many of which are open source. An important part of the selection 
criteria is that they are collaborative and that they have flexible import and 
export capabilities. It is no good having meetings and having working groups 
and then finding that they can only print output and can’t have shared input. 
The solution we have chosen isMindmeister. Like many tools used for business 
analysis, testing and development,Mindmeister  is 
a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution. This provides great flexibility and 
reduces the need to have software installed onto closed PCs or to use licensing 
dongles and allows easier upgrades. The software is free to use with limited 
number of mindmaps in the basic version; the personal version with greater 
number of maps and export formats is £4.99 a month, and the pro version is 
£9.99.

Once the project has a satisfactory outline and the scope has been captured 
with a rough outline of the solution we then use theSpeclog solution to start 
to write the user stories.Speclog  is a tool that is 
designed to look at business requirements and allow them to be described fully. 
For the story based process of specification by example this allows us to 
breakdown an application into its constituent actor goals, business goals and 
user stories. Each core feature is broken out into different user stories. 
Again it has strong collaboration characteristics. We have chosen a server 
version that allows a number of people to work on the same project. Linking 
back to specification by example, the output produced is in Gherkin language.

As part of this process, this is the time when the requirements traceability 
and the summary of requirements documentation is written. This is so there is 
an agreed understanding of the scope of the project. The tools are put in place 
for later test phases that will validate the delivery of the business 
capability.

This takes us back to our initial introduction to specification by example 

 where we worked on user stories and used a Ruby tool calledCucumber that 
allowed the project to be detailed. Cucumber also produced and validated 
Gherkin code. It is a descriptive language that allows requirements to be 
described in the Given When Then format.

 Given that I am a user of the system
 I want to enter a valid order
 So that products can be dispatched

In this example a number of characteristic scenarios would be used when 
describing the order entry feature. An order should have a valid product, 
reject certain types of product, have correct dispatch details, have a correct 
order scheme, contain shipping details, reject incorrect quantity amount and 
produce an order summary. From this the Gherkin user stories would then be 
produced and the developer would start to work on the features that provide 
this software capability.

And this brings us to our last software tool. In order that user stories can 
be discussed with the users and reviewed internally during development and 
testing, we need a tool that can bring together the Gherkin output in a Wiki 
style web site. This is key to the specification by example method where the 
output needs to be the living documentation and reflect the improvements and 
changes that are made to the requirements and how they are met through the 
project. Most importantly, both the SpecLog description (connected to the 
development cycle) and the tool used to monitor the progress of the 
requirements and display their maturing needed to be closely aligned. In theory 
this can be done by putting the Gherkin files into a version control system 
where the software that provides the capability will be developed, but because 
we don’t have the right connectivity and the development processes are not yet 
in place, we have put in a simpler solution. The user stories are being 
published into a file share and then put out into a Wiki style display tool 
calledRelish . This can be used in two ways, 
directly by writing Gherkin feature files using simple editors such as 
Notepad++ or Sublime – plugins to these two products allow them to validate 
Gherkin code.

The linking together of the solution assurance and development processes are 
the next area for examination. When developing features there won’t necessarily 
be a direct one-to-one relationship between developed code modules and the 
stories. Some modules could be used across a number of stories – but in 
different functional capabilities. There will also be a much larger number of 
software modules and the relationship between the stories and the underlying 
code needs to be monitored. This area will require a lot of detailing work.

The final step will be to put the agreed user stories into our test 
management software tool (we usePractitest) as requirements and the write the 
core end-to-end process flows as test scenarios – with the test cases described 
within reflecting the different functional capabilities.

 Conclusion

There are a lot of good quality software tools to help work with 
Specification by Example. Collaboration and flexibility are key – as is basic 
reliability. A time can be seen when there is a end-to-end link up to take 
requirements and produce testable artefacts. The next step in the process will 
be to work out how the development tools will hook into this process and more 
importantly, if we can follow the process fully, is it possible to produce a 
hybrid approach that combines traditional methods with this much leaner 
approach? The biggest challenge with this process is that it works from a 
top-down perspective – where traditional software methods use a combination of 
top-down and bottom-up to ensure that no gaps are inadvertently produced. It is 
addressing this issue that will be the most pressing challenge for 
specification by example.

Are you considering the Performance of your SaaS products? 


The issue of Performance assurance is especially interesting from the 
perspective of SaaS users, since performance has such an effect on page views, 
user satisfaction, conversion rates, bounce rate etc. etc., and SaaS customers 
of course have no control over the infrastructure of the software they are 
using. They must simply have faith that the SaaS product is going to perform, 
and that the providers have taken this into account. This is a consideration 
that US based social login SaaS providerJanrain  
recently came to Intechnica to explore – they wanted to prove to themselves and 
the market that their hosted registration, social profile data collection and 
storage service could handle any load that a potential customer might throw at 
it.

Using Intechnica’s TrafficSpike 
 load testing tool and 
expert analysis, we were able to drill down to the performance capabilities of 
Janrain’sCapture  product and give them 
that peace of mind of exactly how much it could handle comfortably.

To read more about our methodology and results, head over to Janrain’s blog 

, where there is a guest post by Intechnica Senior Performance Consultant Mike 
Horn.

How often do you consider performance when looking at SaaS solutions and 
partners? If you need evidence as to why it’s important to consider, check out

Personal Shopping Assistant 

 

      
Browse tough problems 


Technology guides customers through store aisles, suggesting items to 
purchase, pointing out sales and easing (or avoiding) the check-out line     

It’s not uncommon for busy shoppers to lose their place – and valuable time – 
amid the dizzying array of products and retail store layouts. And retailers – 
in the midst of thebusiness of shopping – often let marketing and 
customer-service opportunities slip through their fingers. But this is an 
opportunity they cannot afford to squander: The competition to attract and 
retain customers is a growing challenge, so retailers must find ways to 
establish stronger customer ties and improve the shopping experience.

 Many companies now use loyalty card programs that offer discounts to repeat 
customers and gather data about their buying habits. The success of such 
programs relies on how companies use and manage that data. Many have spent 
years gathering information with few practical applications, hoping that 
technology would one day catch up with their needs and offer a way to turn data 
into dollars.

That day is here. IBM Global Business Services, IBM Research and IBM Retail 
Store Solutions teamed with Cuesol, an IBM Business Partner, to find a way to 
help turn customer information into useful, profitable action for a large 
retail grocery chain. With more than 345 stores in the northeastern United 
States, the company was seeking to solidify its customer base and trigger 
incremental sales.

Although the grocer already had an existing loyalty card program, it wanted a 
more precise, cost-effective way to reach customers – notafter they made their 
purchases, but during the decision-making process. The company sought a 
solution that would allow customers to better manage their time in the store, 
help them navigate the aisles quickly and reduce wait times. The grocer also 
wanted to hone its marketing efforts to reach shoppers with relevant, targeted 
promotions as they traversed the aisles.

The solution was the IBM Personal Shopping Assistant called Shopping Buddy 
, which 
consists of a data management system, Wi-Fi network, infrared technology and 
Bluetooth transmissions centered around touch-screen computers mounted on 
shopping cart handles. It uses IBM Store Integration Framework, IBM WebSphere® 
Application Server, IBM WebSphere MQ messaging software, IBM Tivoli® management 
software, IBM Mobile Tablet for Retail, as well as Cuesol’s Cart Companion® 
browser software.

 IBM Research teamed with IBM’s Retail Store Solution division to assist in 
prototyping various aspects of the IBM Personal Shopping Assistant for the 
Store Integration Framework. An in-store retail commerce server prototype was 
created, which integrated the Shopping Buddies, the location service and the 
point-of-sale terminal controller. The service-oriented architecture adopted by 
the in-store server provided the basis for the prototyping of various store 
services, such as data replications, offer presentations and gift registry. The 
in-store server also served as the test environment for the development of the 
Shopping Buddy prototype.

 In practice, customers scan in their loyalty cards to activate a familiar, 
Web-style screen with a variety of display options, such as sale items or a 
list of products shoppers buy most frequently. A location-tracking system 
monitored through ceiling-mounted beacons enables the retailer to pinpoint 
shoppers’ locations and deliver relevant real-time information as they move 
through the store.

 The system integrates with the company’s backend systems, so buying histories 
and favorite items can be displayed on the screen as a constant reminder of 
products to buy. The device also lets shoppers order cold cuts from the deli, 
sending an alert when the order is ready. An attached imaging scanner invites 
consumers to scan items as they place them in the cart, keeping a running total 
(of expenses and savings) along the way and completing their transaction using 
IBM self-checkout systems.

Based on the success of the initial engagement, the company plans to extend 
the technology to as many as 150 locations.

 Meanwhile, IBM Research is exploring ways to refine Personal Shopping 
Assistant technology with customer-sensitive features, such as suggesting a 
wine to go with a meal or providing dietary guidance on specific items. 
Researchers see Shopping Buddy as a prime candidate for moving Web technology 
closer to the physical world, with, for example, ads targeted to individual 
consumers, based on prior purchases, in the precise environment where they are 
primed to make a purchase – just as camera ads show up on your computer screen 
when you query your search engine for camera. IBM researchers also say the 
technology could be extended to other retailers and retail sectors.

IBM Personal Shopping Assistant puts technology at shoppers’ fingertips, 
giving them better control over their shopping experience, and provides 
retailers with a practical on demand solution.

This program will introduce participants to “systems thinking” as a response 
to the rapid changes in technology, population, and economic activity that are 
transforming the world, and as a way to deal with the ever increasing 
complexity of today's business. Systems thinking was devised to improve 
people's ability to manage organizations comprehensively in a volatile global 
environment. It offers managers a framework for understanding complex 
situations and the dynamics those situations produce. Senior managers can use 
the system dynamics method to design policies that lead their organizations to 
high performance. The program is intended to give participants the tools and 
confidence to manage organizations with full understanding and solid strategy.

Join the MySloanExecEd Community Group 
 for this program to 
network with past, present, and future participants.



The program will offer a new way of thinking about and resolving complex, 
persistent problems that emerge from change. Applying organization theory along 
with intuitive principles of feedback control, participants will learn to:


 * Assess the likely impact of different policies and decisions that relate to 
their organization's growth, stability, and performance 
 * Recognize business system archetypes that can trigger persistent, long-term 
problems 
 * Use state-of-the-art management tools to identify relationships 
 * Intervene effectively to make fundamental changes This program is designed 
for executives with decision-making responsibility who are looking for fresh 
ideas to resolve organizational problems. Past participants have included:


 * CEOs 
 * Presidents 
 * COOs 
 * CTOs 
 * VPs and EVPs 
 * Corporate planners and strategists 
 * Senior Project Managers 
 * Product Development Managers Please note that faculty are subject to change 
and not all faculty teach in each session of the program.

dynamically complex problems in organizations, organizational change, and 
management using the tools of system dynamics. His research centers on why 
organizations find it difficult to do what they want to do. Morrison focuses on 
implementation problems, which he has studied in several contexts, such as 
process improvement settings and firms adopting the practices of lean 
manufacturing. He tries to understand why some cases lead to successful 
implementation, while others lead to failures. For example, why do apparently 
well-intended actions often lead to outcomes that differ greatly from people?s 
intentions? How do the actions some managers take foster the very problems they 
are attempting to solve? His research is strongly rooted in organizational 
theory, with a methodological emphasis on interpretation through the lens of 
system dynamics.

Over a 20-year career with a leading management consulting firm, Morrison has 
assisted dozens of organizations that wrestle with change in areas such as 
product development and supply chain management. His consulting clients have 
included agencies of the United States and other governments, global consumer 
products firms, major retailers, and professional services firms. He has 
extensive experience in Asia, having worked in 11 countries on projects for 
clients from North America, Asia, and Europe.



Morrison teaches at MIT in the System Design and Management program, the 
Leaders for Manufacturing program, Executive Education programs at the MIT 
Sloan School of Management, and the Undergraduate Practice Opportunities 
Program. He is a senior scientist in the Pre-Conflict Anticipation and Shaping 
research team at MIT. Morrison teaches courses in business dynamics, operations 
management, and supply chain management in the MBA program at Brandeis 
University?s International Business School.



He holds a PhD in management (system dynamics and organization studies) from 
the MIT Sloan School of Management, an MBA in finance from the University of 
Chicago Graduate School of Business, and undergraduate degrees in chemistry and 
management science from MIT. (less )

AI-complete - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   AI-complete

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  Jump to: navigation 
, search 
 In the field of artificial 
intelligence , the most 
difficult problems are informally known asAI-complete or AI-hard, implying that 
the difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to that of solving 
the central artificial intelligence problem—making computers as intelligent as 
people, orstrong AI .[1] 
 To call a 
problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a 
simple specific algorithm.

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include computer vision 
, natural language understanding 
, and dealing with 
unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem.[2] 


With current technology, AI-complete problems cannot be solved by computer 
alone, but also requirehuman computation 
. This property can be useful, 
for instance to test for the presence of humans as withCAPTCHAs 
, and for computer security 
 to circumvent brute-force 
attacks .[3]

History

The term was coined by Fanya Montalvo 
[citation needed 
] by analogy with 
NP-complete  and NP-hard 
 in complexity theory 
, which formally 
describes the most famous class of difficult problems.[5] 
 Early uses of the term 
are in Erik Mueller's 1987 Ph.D. dissertation[6] 
 and in Eric Raymond 
's 1991 Jargon File 
.[7] 


[edit 
] 
AI-complete problems

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include:


 * Computer vision  (and 
subproblems such asobject recognition 
) 
 * Natural language understanding 
 (and subproblems 
such astext mining , machine 
translation , and word sense 
disambiguation ) 
 * Dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem, 
whether it'snavigation  or 
planning  or 
even the kind ofreasoning  done by 
expert systems . [edit 
] 
Machine translation

Main article: Machine translation 
 To translate accurately, a 
machine must be able to understand the text. It must be able to follow the 
author's argument, so it must have some ability toreason 

. It must have extensiveworld knowledge 
 so that it knows what is 
being discussed — it must at least be familiar with all the same commonsense 
facts that the average human translator knows. Some of this knowledge is in the 
form of facts that can be explicitly represented, but some knowledge is 
unconscious and closely tied to the human body: for example, the machine may 
need to understand how an ocean makes onefeel to accurately translate a 
specific metaphor in the text. It must also model the authors' goals, 
intentions, and emotional states to accurately reproduce them in a new 
language. In short, the machine is required to have wide variety of human 
intellectual skills, includingreason 

,commonsense knowledge  and 
the intuitions that underliemotion and manipulation 
, perception 
, and social intelligence 
. 
Machine translation , 
therefore, is believed to be AI-complete: it may requirestrong AI 
 to be done as well as humans can do it.

[edit 
] 
Software brittleness

Main article: Software brittleness 
 AI systems can solve very 
simple restricted versions of AI-complete problems, but never in their full 
generality. When AI researchers attempt to "scale up" their systems to handle 
more complicated, real world situations, the programs tend to become excessively
brittle  without commonsense 
knowledge  or a rudimentary 
understanding of the situation: they fail as unexpected circumstances outside 
of its original problem context begin to appear. When human beings are dealing 
with new situations in the world, they are helped immensely by the fact that 
they know what to expect: they know what all things around them are, why they 
are there, what they are likely to do and so on. They can recognize unusual 
situations and adjust accordingly. A machine withoutstrong AI 
 has no other skills to fall back on.[8]
 

[edit 
] 
Formalization

Computational complexity theory 
 deals with the 
relative computational difficulty ofcomputable functions 
. By definition it does not 
cover problems whose solution are unknown or have not been characterised 
formally. Since many AI problems have no formalisation yet, conventional 
complexity theory does not allow the definition of AI-completeness.

To address this problem, a complexity theory for AI has been proposed.[9] 
 It is based on 
amodel of computation  that 
splits the computational burden between a computer and a human: one part is 
solved by computer and the other part solved by human. This is formalised by a
human-assistedTuring machine . The 
formalisation defines algorithm complexity, problem complexity and reducibility 
which in turn allowsequivalence classes 
 to be defined.

The complexity of executing an algorithm with a human-assisted Turing machine 
is given by a pair, where the first element represents the complexity of the 
human's part and the second element is the complexity of the machine's part.

[edit

Results

The complexity of solving the following problems with a human-assisted Turing 
machine is:[9] 


 * Optical character recognition 
 for printed text: 
 * Turing test : 
 * for an -sentence conversation where the oracle remembers the conversation 
history (persistent oracle): 
 * for an -sentence conversation where the conversation history must be 
retransmitted: 
 * for an -sentence conversation where the conversation history must be 
retransmitted and the person takes linear time to read the query 
 * ESP game : 
 * Image labelling (based on the Arthur–Merlin protocol 
): 
 * Image classification 
: human 
only:, and with less reliance on the human: . [edit

New Software Demos

Tue April 9 2013   By Kevin Rossiter

 Here at 
Rossiter & Co we have been busy perfecting the art of sales winning Software 
Demos.

Over the past couple of months we have been making a steady stream of demos.

Ranging from ‘dashboard click-through’ videos, to high-level overviews of 
sophisticated software.

- We’ve made them all!!

Take a look at some of our most recent examples:

ClickTrade – Commodity broker software

Clearer comprehensive charts and reports means faster tactical 
decision-making in the high speed commodity broking marketplace.

This video explains how ClickTrade solves these tough problems for the big 
city broker.

 

Watch Video  


WnDirect – International etailer software

Delivering product overseas is a minefield for the international retailer – 
the etailer.

WnDirect needed a video that showed how their software solves all these 
problems in a easy to understand way that etailers will automatically like!

 

Watch Video  


Mex maintenance software

The beauty of Mex for engineers is that it solves real world maintenance 
management problems comprehensively, while being clear and obvious with it’s 
intuitive GUI and ease of use.

But it takes a video to show this.

 

Watch Video  
 

Sefaira – Sustainable building design software

Sefaira wanted a 1 minute ‘quickie’ video to overview their innovative design 
package, followed by a 4 minute feature Video that shows architects how to 
solve their sustainable building design problems

Watch Video  

Satbill – Airtime billing software

Satbill reduces billing costs by drawing together the numerous and varied 
billing types into a single GUI, reducing what took hours and days manually 
into seconds and minutes.

It took a video to show this simplicity to a potentially dis-believing 
audience

"Percent of" Word Problems:
      Markup and Markdown Examples (page 2 of 3)

Sections: Basic percentage exercises 
, Markup / markdown, General 
increase / decrease 

An important category of percentage exercises is markup and markdown 
problems. For these, you calculate the markup or markdown in absolute terms 
(you find by how much the quantity changed), and then you calculate the percent 
change relative to the original value. So they're really just another form of 
"increase - decrease" exercises.


 * A computer software retailer used a markup rate of 40%. Find the selling 
price of a computer game that cost the retailer$25. The markup is 40% of the $25
 cost, so the markup is:

(0.40)(25) = 10

Then the selling price, being the cost plus markup, is:

25 + 10 = 35

The item sold for $35.


 * A golf shop pays its wholesaler $40 for a certain club, and then sells it 
to a golfer for$75. What is the markup rate? First, I'll calculate the markup 
in absolute terms:

75 ? 40 = 35

Then I'll find the relative markup over the original price, or the markup 
rate:($35) is (some percent) of ($40), or:   Copyright © Elizabeth Stapel 
1999-2011 All Rights Reserved

35 = (x)(40)

...so the relative markup over the original price is:

35 ÷ 40 = x = 0.875

Since x stands for a percentage, I need to remember to convert this decimal 
value to the corresponding percentage.

The markup rate is 87.5%.


 * A shoe store uses a 40% markup on cost. Find the cost of a pair of shoes 
that sells for$63.

This problem is somewhat backwards. They gave me the selling price, which is 
cost plus markup, and they gave me the markup rate, but they didn't tell me the 
actual cost or markup. So I have to be clever to solve this.

I will let "x" be the cost. Then the markup, being 40% of the cost, is 0.40x. 
And the selling price of$63 is the sum of the cost and markup, so:

63 = x + 0.40x 
63 = 1x + 0.40x 
63 = 1.40x 
63 ÷ 1.40 = x= 45 


The shoes cost the store $45.


 * An item originally priced at $55 is marked 25% off. What is the sale price? 
First, I'll find the markdown. The markdown is25% of the original price of $55, 
so:

x = (0.25)(55) = 13.75

By subtracting this markdown from the original price, I can find the sale 
price:

55 ? 13.75 = 41.25

The sale price is $41.25.


 * An item that regularly sells for $425 is marked down to $318.75. What is 
the discount rate? First, I'll find the amount of the markdown:

425 ? 318.75 = 106.25

Then I'll calculate "the markdown over the original price", or the markdown 
rate:($106.25) is (some percent) of ($425), so:

106.25 = (x)(425)

...and the relative markdown over the original price is:

x = 106.25 ÷ 425 = 0.25

Since the "x" stands for a percentage, I need to remember to convert this 
decimal to percentage form.

The markdown rate is 25%.


 * An item is marked down 15%; the sale price is $127.46. What was the 
original price? This problem is backwards. They gave me the sale price ($127.46)
 and the markdown rate(15%), but neither the markdown amount nor the original 
price. I will let "x" stand for the original price. Then the markdown, being 15%
 of this price, was0.15x. And the sale price is the original price, less the 
markdown, so I get:

x ? 0.15x = 127.46 
1x ? 0.15x = 127.46 
0.85x = 127.46 
x = 127.46 ÷ 0.85 = 149.952941176... 

This problem didn't state how to round the final answer, but 
dollars-and-cents is always written with two decimal places, so:

The original price was $149.95.

Note in this last problem that I ended up, in the third line of calculations, 
with an equation that said "eighty-five percent of the original price is$127.46
". You can save yourself some time if you think of discounts in this way: if 
the price is15% off, then you're only actually paying 85%. Similarly, if the 
price is25% off, then you're paying 75%; if the price is 30% off, then you're 
paying70%; and so on.

 * Fast Company  4 Problems Google Glasses Have To 
Solve Before Becoming A Hit

Google is planning to augment reality, and it’s a design problem that will 
require more than mere algorithms to solve.

119 Comments 

0 5 Google has never been a design-forward company, revolutionizing our lives 
through interface design. Instead, they’ve taken over the world building 
products with raw intellectual horsepower--brilliant artificial intelligence to 
fuel search, wise mapping systems to take us from point A to point B, and 
clever cloud-syncing apps that allow us to collaborate on projects from around 
the globe. Google never had to be pretty. It’s always been smart.

Yesterday, Google officially revealed a project that will push them to their 
creative limits. It’s called Project Glass, and it’s a pair of glasses that 
layers digital information over the real world.

It’s your smartphone, right in your eyes. You can read text messages. You can 
take photos. You can listen to music (thanks to some built-in earbuds). You can 
even be told that the subway is closed as you walk up to it, and be redirected 
to your destination by foot.

It’s your smartphone, right in your eyes. But maybe most notably, nothing 
about what Google has presented is an actual product yet, or considered close 
to finalized. “We wanted to let people know about what we’re doing, and what we 
hope to achieve with it,” a Google spokesperson told Co.Design, “But in terms 
of the graphics, the visuals, the hardware setup, there’s a lot of 
experimentation going on. And a lot of rapid prototyping on the team.”

The concept video Google has shared is meant to signify what the team feels 
“would be of most value to people,” and what they’re closest to actualizing. 
Now that this concept is public, Google will be entering what they called the 
“feedback gathering phase,” in which they’re looking for the community to chime 
in on what they want to see (and don’t want to see) in a fully realized product.

So where does this leave us for now? What Google has shown is promising, but 
their design challenges are clear:

1. Google Needs To Avoid "The Segway Problem" 

There’s a reason that video glasses haven’t taken off yet (and by that, I 
don’t mean augmented reality glasses like Google’s, but something more like 
Vuzix). And, for lack of a better term, we’ll call it The Segway Problem. 
Technology can be a symbol of your future-forwardness, or it can be the exact 
opposite: a sign of the future’s ridiculousness. The Segway flopped in part for 
its cost and in part for the fact that humanity isn’t quite that lazy, but 
there was a deeper, visceral reaction to the core of the product that signified 
a silly future rather than an inspiring one. So far, the actual glasses Google 
is showing off aren’t inspiring. To succeed, Google will need to sell us on 
either the stylishness, or the invisibility, of video glasses. And may we 
suggest copying the iPod in this approach? Make the technology as obscured on 
the user as possible, except for one trademark calling card (in the iPod’s 
case, white earbuds).

2. Google Needs To Navigate "The Always On Problem" 

As inspiring as moments in Google’s concept video may be--and the 
photo-taking moment is an aha moment if I’ve ever seen one--it’s also stuffed 
with notification, none of which is fundamentally different from what we could 
be checking on our cell phones less intrusively. The functions that Google 
blocks will be as integral to the platform’s success as those that are enabled. 
Finding the perfect level of obtrusiveness within an omnipresent Internet 
connection could be the largest challenge of human-device interaction the 
electronics industry has ever encountered. And as Google is paving new ground, 
they’re working outside their comfort zone: Google has no data to mine for how 
much notification is too much notification. If ever there’s been a product ripe 
for Google Labs field testing, it’s Project Glass.

3. Google Needs To Find A Killer Use-Case 

People in the Valley used to talk all the time about finding "killer 
apps"--that is, the one, defining use of a technology that’ll spark its mass 
adoption. And no wonder: With technologies such as augmented reality and 
Project Glass, the possibilites seem to outstrip the actual need. As I 
suggested before, these glasses aren’t yet doing anything our phones can’t. So 
why do they need to be glasses?

A good counter-example is the iPad. Lots of people dismissed it when it first 
came out, saying, "Sure, it’s cool, but what does anyone need another computer 
for?" Well, it turns out, people didn’tneed another computer so much as they 
wanted one--a computer that would make surfing the web from your bed or couch a 
lot less clunky and more fun. With Project Glass, I’m not sure that they have 
that use-case yet--that is, the perfect scenario where this just makes sense in 
people’s lives. There might be some set of features and interactions that makes 
it so, but these haven’t quite appeared just yet.

4. Google Needs To Attenuate "The Too Much Feedback Problem" 

Where Project Glass is at now, what one spokesperson labeled “the feedback 
gathering phase” in our brief conversation today, is a tenuous spot to be in. 
Crowdsourcing can create great products, but when it comes to inventing 
something that no one has conceptualized before, we need bold visionaries, not 
naysaying Internet whiners. Not just anyone can design a user interface. And 
I’d posit that almost no one can design a usable interface that will sit in our 
eyeballs 24/7. Crowdsourcing user feedback at the invisible level--the advanced 
A/B testing Google does when they test the color blue without us even knowing 
it--could be integral to fine tuning Project Glass at a number of levels. But 
at heart, they will need to present us with a most singular vision if they 
expect any of us to don a pair of glasses, not a mishmash of suggestions from 
the peanut gallery.

The softest touches of design will define Project Glass’s future. The little 
things, the softest touches of design, will define Project Glass’s future in 
the marketplace. Is the interface loud or quiet? Do we use vocal commands with 
some functions or all functions? Are notifications really in the center of the 
screen, or can they be repositioned? Will images be opaque or partially 
transparent? What will the glasses show when I sit at my computer or when I 
drive? All of these “how does it feel” components will matter even more than 
they do in a cell phone. But on top of all this, and maybe most importantly, 
we’ll need to know the one big reason that we’ll all want to wear our phones 
rather than keep them tucked away in our pockets. As of right now, I don’t 
think we’ve seen it.

Most of us interact with at least one Google product every day. Many of us 
use their products all day, every day. Whether or not you’ve been particularly 
inspired by their design, you can’t argue that their approach hasn’t worked 
well enough so far.

But it’s been a while since Google was the first to market in uncharted 
territory (and it begs the question, have they ever been, really?). Wearing a 
computer has the potential to redefine the human experience even more than PCs 
or smartphones did. With Project Glass, Google has the task of designing the 
interface of our lives, and I can’t imagine a greater challenge ahead of them.
